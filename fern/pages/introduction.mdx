title: Vectara REST API v2
---

[Vectara](https://vectara.com/) is the trusted GenAI and semantic search platform that provides an easy-to-use API for document indexing and querying. 

Vectara provides an end-to-end managed service for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG-as-a-service), which is:
* **Easy to use**: Vectara provides an end-to-end, fully functional, highly scalable and robust RAG pipeline, so as a user you don't have to code up these pieces and maintain them over time.
* **Scalable and Secure**: building GenAI applications may seem easy at first, but the DIY approach can become overwhelming beyond simple examples. Vectara provides instant scalablility to millions of documents, while maintaing data security and privacy, as well as latency SLAs.

To get started with Vectara, [sign up for an account](https://console.vectara.com/signup?utm_source=vectara&utm_medium=signup&utm_term=DevRel&utm_content=Fern-SDK&utm_campaign=vectara-signup-DevRel-Fern-SDK) 
(if you haven't already) and follow our [quickstart](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/quickstart) guide to create a corpus and an API key. 

The Vectara [API Playground](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/rest-api/) lets you experiment with REST endpoints from your browser. Select an endpoint to view its definition, 
including the required or optional headers, body, responses, and sample commands. 
On the right side of each endpoint page, like [Query Corpus](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/rest-api/query-corpus), you manually enter your API Key or OAuth Bearer Token, `customer_id`, and then any required body parameters like the `corpusID` before sending the API request.

<Note title="Authentication">
Vectara supports two primary methods of authentication: API keys and OAuth 2.0, which are applicable to all endpoints. Query API Keys are used for read-only querying operations, while Index API Keys provide read and write access. The OAuth 2.0 operations authenticate with a Bearer Token via the OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant. Review the [OAuth 2.0 section]() about how to generate the token.
