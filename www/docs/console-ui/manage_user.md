This section lets you add team members and manage the access levels of these 
users. For example, you can adjust account and corpus level authorizations. 
You can also transfer your Vectara account ownership to another user.

how to set up user permissions, review [enterprise access patterns](/docs/learn/authentication/personas-and-access-patterns), authentication methods and so on.
