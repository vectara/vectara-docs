In this section, you will learn how to create and manage a user, including
adjusting account and corpus level authorizations.

## Add User

Users can be created by the account administrator. Once you've logged in,
navigate to the **User** tab under **Authentication** to create new users
and manage existing ones. You can create a new user by
clicking the **Create User** button.

Optionally, a user may be assigned one or more roles. The roles include account
administrator, corpus administrator, and billing administrator. A user without
assigned roles at the account level can still be given corpus-level roles, as
described later.

## Edit User

A list of all users is available on the User screen. An existing user can be
modified directly from this list by clicking the three-dotted button at the far
right of the row. This includes changing role assignments, password resets,
enabling and disabling the user, and transferring owership of the account to
a new owner.
