This section lets you add team members and manage the access levels of these 
users. For example, you can adjust account and corpus level authorizations.

## Create User

The Account Admin can create users. After login, 
navigate to the **Teams** tab to create new users
and manage existing ones. 

1. Click **Create User**
2. Enter the user's details including the user name, email, and a 
   description.
3. Select a role or multiple roles to assign with this user: Account Admin, 
   Corpus Admin, or Billing Admin. A user without assigned roles at the 
   account level can still be given corpus-level roles.

## Edit User

The Team page also lets you modify users directly from the user 
list by clicking the drop-down on the right side of of the row. This 
includes changing role assignments, password resets, enabling and disabling 
the user, and transferring ownership of the account to
a new owner.
