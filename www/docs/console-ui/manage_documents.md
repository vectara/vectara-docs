The List Documents view provides information about each document ingested into 
the corpus. This information includes the Document ID, title, size, date 
added, and metadata. This enables you to catalog and inventory large amounts 
of data while also extracting lists of documents for further analysis. This 
information helps you better manage the lifecycle of your documents. This page 
provides a quick way to check which documents are already in the index:

* Utilize the metadata to build custom search and filtering capabilities 
  into applications
* Gather Documentation IDs that you can reference for future purposes
  such as deletion for audit and compliance reasons.
* Delete documents from the corpus so that the data no longer appears in 
  queries.
