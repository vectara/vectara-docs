Vectara Chat provides an interactive user experience that enables you to build 
domain-specific chatbots using RAG. Vectara Chat remembers chat histories and 
leads to more relevant responses in different scenarios like customer support. 
Every Vectara account has a unique Chat History Corpus which stores all chat 
histories.

You can chat with your data directly from the Vectara Console from within the 
Query tab of a corpus.

## Enable Chat

You enable chat in the Query tab of a specific corpus.

1. Navigate to a corpus from the list.
2. Select the **Query** tab and go to the Generation section.
3. Select **Chat** and enable the Chat toggle.
4. Now you can [chat with your data](/docs/console-ui/chat-with-your-data)!

## Manage Conversations

The Conversations page lists the conversations in your chat history corpus:
