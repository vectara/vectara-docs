Follow the steps below to update the payment information for your account.

1. Make sure that you are logged in as user having either the **Billing Admin**
   or **Account Owner** role. To learn how to assign a specific role to a user,
   see the guide for [managing users](manage-user).

2. Click **Billing** in the left navigation window. If you do not
   see this option, then you do not have sufficient privileges. Ask your 
   account owner to make you a billing administrator.
