Follow the steps below to update the payment information for your account.

1. Make sure that you are logged in as user having either the **Billing Admin**
   or **Account Owner** role. To learn how to assign a specific role to a user,
   see the guide for [managing users](manage-user).

2. Click on the **Billing** node in the left navigation window. If you do not
   see it, then you do not have sufficient privileges. Ask your account owner
   to make you a billing administrator.

   **Edit Payment Method** popover dialog.

4. Enter your payment details, and click **Update**. A confirmation pop up
   message indicates that the payment method has been updated. 

Congratulations. You have successfully updated the payment method and your 
payments going forward will be processed with it.
