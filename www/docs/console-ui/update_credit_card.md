The Billing page provides information about your product usage and current 
plan. For example, if you signed up for a trial, this page says that your 
current plan is **Free Trial** and when the trial ends.

The **Usage** tab shows the resource usage for the current period, such as the 
number of requests. It also shows charges and billing history.

The **Current plan** tab shows an overview about your plan, such as the amount of 
data storage and number of queries. This tab also shows your Billing details 
where you can edit the billing contact details and your payment method.

The **Upgrade** tab shows the available subscription plans such as Standard, 
Pro, Enterprise, VPC, and On-prem. It also lets you compare plans.
