After creating an agent, you can chat with it directly in the Vectara Console.

## Start chatting with agents

1. Navigate to **Agents** in the sidebar.
2. Click your agent name to open its details.
3. Click the **Chat** tab.
4. Type your question and press Enter.

That's it! The agent responds using its configured tools and instructions.

## What you will see

When the agent responds, you see the following information:
- Your original question
- The agent's response
- Source citations (when applicable)
- Tool usage indicators (web search or corpus search)

## Start a new conversation

Click **New Session** to start fresh without previous chat history.

## Test your agent

Test your agent to see if it's working as expected:
1. Check that it's "Enabled" in the agents list
2. Verify your question matches the agent's configured tools
3. Try asking "What can you help with?"

For more examples, see [Example Agents](/docs/console-ui/agents/example-agents).
