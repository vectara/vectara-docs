To get begin searching your data, you first have to create an index. An index, 
also referenced as a corpus, is a container where you upload all your data to 
be ingested and grouped together in a single location for querying.

1.  To get started, navigate to the [Console Overview](https://console.vectara.com/overview).

2. On the left sidebar, you'll see an **Indices** section. Click on it. This 
   will open an overview of the incides you have created. It will be empty 
   if this is your first time accessing the console.

3.  Now click on the **Create Index** button, a dialog box will open. Enter the
    name and description of the index.

4.  Leave all settings on their default values and click create. Once created,
    you will see a confirmation message and the newly created index listed
    below.
