To get begin searching your data, you first have to create an index. An index, 
also referenced as a corpus, is a container where you upload all your data 
to be injested and grouped together in a single location for querying.

1.  To get started, navigate to the [Console Overview](https://console.vectara.com/overview).

2.  On the left sidebar, you'll see a **Indices** section. Click on it. This will
    open an overview of the indices you have created. 
    
    :::note
    The Indices list is empty if this
    is your first time accessing the console.
    :::

3.  Click the **Create Index** button, and a dialog box will open. 
4.  Enter the
    name and description of the index.

5.  Leave all settings on their default values and click create. 
   
    Once created, you will see a confirmation message and the newly created index listed
    below.

The index is now created and ready to receive your data. You might want to head
towards how to index data and the index overview.
