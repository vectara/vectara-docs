To begin searching your data, you first have to create a corpus. A corpus 
is a container where you upload all your data to be ingested and grouped 
together in a single location for querying.

1. To get started, navigate to the [Console Overview](https://console.vectara.com/overview).

2. On the left sidebar, click **Corpora**. This 
   will open an overview of the incides you have created. It will be empty 
   if this is your first time accessing the console.

3. Click **Create corpus** and a dialog box appears.
4. Enter the name and description of the corpus.
5. Select an Embedding Model (Boomerand is default).
6. Specify any Filter Attributes.
7. (Optional) Click **Inspect** and the request inspector appears. You can now 
   optionally create this corpus by copying and pasting the application code 
   in NodeJS, JavaScript, Linux, or Windows.

The corpus is created and a confirmation message appears. It is now ready to 
receive your data.
