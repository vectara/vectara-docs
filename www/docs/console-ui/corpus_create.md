To begin searching your data, you first have to create a corpus. A corpus 
is like a container where you upload all your data to be ingested and grouped 
together in a single location for querying.

1. To get started, navigate to the [Console Overview](https://console.vectara.com/overview).

2. On the left sidebar, click **Corpora**. This 
   will open an overview of the corpora you have created. It will be empty 
   if this is your first time accessing the console.

3. Now click on the **Create corpus** button, a dialog box will open. Enter the
    name and description of the corpus.

4. Leave all settings on their default values and click **Create**. Once 
   created, you will see a confirmation message and the newly created 
   corpus listed below.

The corpus is now created and ready to receive your data. You might want to head
towards how to index data and the index overview.
