To begin searching your data, you first have to create a corpus. A corpus 
is a container where you upload all your data to be indexed and grouped 
together in a single location for querying.

1. To get started, navigate to the [Console Overview](https://console.vectara.com/overview).

2. Click **Corpora** on the left sidebar. This will open an overview of the 
   corpora you have created. It will be empty if this is your first time 
   accessing the console.

3.  Now click **Create Corpus** and a dialog box will open. Enter the
    name and description of the corpus.

4.  Leave all settings on their default values and click create. Once created,
    you will see a confirmation message and the newly created corpus listed
    below.

The corpus is now created and ready to receive your data. You might want to head
towards how to index data and the corpus overview.
