Follow the steps below to configure server access to a corpus. This access is
commonly needed when your systems will be indexing data into the corpus or
running queries against it.

1. Make sure that you have an [app client] for your server already created.

2. Navigate to your desired corpus by either clicking its name in the left
   sidebar or through the **Corpora** page.

3. Click the **Authorization** tab.
   
:::note
   
   If you don't see an Authorization tab, you lack sufficient privileges. Ask your Account 
   or Corpus Admin to grant you privileges on this corpus.

1. Click **Create user role**.
2. Select a user in the Name dropdown, select the
   desired role(s) and add an optional description.  Usually, the appropriate
   roles will be indexing (IDX), or querying (QRY), or both.

6. Click **Create**. This will create a new role for your user. 

Congratulations. You have successfully authorized a server to access the corpus.
