If you decide to stop using a corpus you have three options.

1. **Disable**: Disables query or indexing requests. A disabled corpus can be
   reenabled at any time from this same page.
2. **Reset**: Clear all the data within the corpus, but leave the corpus
   definition intact.
3. **Delete**: Purge all the data within the corpus and delete the corpus.
   All your connected services to the corpus will also cease to function.
