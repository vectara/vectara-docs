title: Reset or Delete a Corpus
---

If you decide to stop using a corpus you have three options.

1. **Disable**: Disables query or indexing requests. A disabled corpus can be
   reenabled at any time from this same page.
2. **Reset**: Clear all the data within the corpus, but leave the corpus
   definition intact.
3. **Delete**: Purge all the data within the corpus and delete the corpus.
   All your connected services to the corpus will also cease to function.

:::caution
The **Reset** and **Delete** operations are irreversable.
:::

The Dangerous actions section of the Manage corpus page lets you disable, 
reset, or delete a corpus.

1. Select the drop-down menu of your corpus name and click Manage.
2. Go to the bottom of the Manage page to the Danagerous actions section.
3. Select **Disable corpus**, **Clear corpus data**, or **Delete corpus**.
