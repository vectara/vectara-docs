## Endpoint Address

<Config v="names.product"/> exposes an HTTP endpoint at the following URL
to upload and index documents into a corpus:
<code>https://<Config v="domains.rest.indexing"/>/v1/upload</code>
This page describes the details
of interacting with this endpoint.

## Request Details

The endpoint expects an `multipart/form-data` `POST` request that includes the
following HTTP parameters:

1.  `c` [required]: Customer ID.

2.  `o` [required]: Corpus ID into which the document should be indexed.

3.  `d` [optional]: If set to `true`, the server returns the extracted
document that was indexed. This parameter is useful when a raw file is
being uploaded (e.g., pdf, docx) instead of a file containing the
`Document` proto message (e.g., pbtxt, pb, json). The caller can inspect
the retruned extracted `Document` proto message from the raw file.

Apart from these parameters, the servers expect a valid JWT Token in the HTTP
headers.

The maximum file size supported by the server is 10 MB.

You can attach additional metadata to the file by specifying an additional
`doc_metadata` form field, which can contain a JSON string:

```json
doc_metadata='{ "filesize": 1234 }'
```


## Response Codes

The server responds with `200` when the file was uploaded and indexed
successfully. Note that it may still take a few minutes (typically 5-10 mins)
before the document is served.

Some error codes returned by the server are:

-  `400`: An invalid request was sent. E.g., one of the required parameters
was missing, or the corpus ID does not exist.

-  `401`: The caller is not authenticated.

-  `403`: The caller is not authorized to add documents to the corpus.

-  `409`: A document already exists in the corpus with the same document ID,
yet the contents of the indexed document are different than the file being
uploaded. Since the indexer is idempotent, the same document (identified by
the document ID) can be uploaded multiple times. The indexer does not support
updates yet, so an error is returned when a different document is uploaded for
the same document ID. Note that when a raw file is uploaded, the file name is
used as the document ID.

-  `507`: There is no more indexing quota left for the corpus or customer to
index more documents.

## Command Line Invocation

The following command shows how to upload a file `/tmp/instructions.pdf` to
corpus `151` in customer `123456` using `curl`.
