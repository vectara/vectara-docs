The Delete Documents API lets you delete a document from a corpus. To verify
that the document no longer exists in the corpus, use the List Documents endpoint.

### Delete Document Request and Response

To delete a document, send a DELETE request to `/v2/corpora/{corpus_key}/documents/{document_id}`,
where `{corpus_key}` is the unique identifier for the corpus and `{document_id}`
is the ID of the document you want to delete. The `document_id` is a string
that uniquely identifies the document within the corpus. The `document_id`
must be [percent encoded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding).

The reply on successful deletion is `{}`.
