In <Config v="names.product"/>, when you [index a document](/docs/api-reference/indexing-apis/indexing), the 
document has a `type` parameter that determines the format of the document 
as `core` or `structured`. The `core` type has `document_parts` and the `structured` 
type has `sections`. Both can be nested and both can contain separate `metadata`, 
including some metadata that <Config v="names.product"/> will auto-generate. 
A good example of this is that you could have a document which has some global 
attributes like the `URL` or `owner` but individual sections will have a `section` 
attribute and a `lang`.


Here's an example response with different metadata at these different levels:

```json
{
  "search_results": [
    {
      "text": "Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything, is 42.",
      "score": 0.1401531994342804,
      "part_metadata": {
        "speaker": "Deep Thought",
        "lang": "eng",
        "section": "2",
        "offset": "316"
      },
      "document_metadata": {
        "author": "Douglas Adams",
        "publicationyear": "1979"
      },
      "document_id": "hitchhikers-guide",
      "request_corpora_index": 0
    },
    {
      "text": "Sometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple.",
      "score": 0.13511724770069122,
      "part_metadata": {
        "lang": "eng",
        "section": "17",
        "offset": "171"
      },
      "document_metadata": {
        "author": "Dr. Seuss"
      },
      "document_id": "authors-quotes",
      "request_corpora_index": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

Within a given item in the `search_results` array, you'll see there's a `part_metadata`
and a `document_metadata` section (among others). The `part_metadata` section holds
section-level metadata and the `document_metadata` section holds document-level
metadata. The reason for this split is that there may be multiple sections
from the same document in the response, and this allows for deduplication of
document-level metadata, which can reduce the total time for the response.

## Combining document and section metadata

In order to display metadata for a particular section, you may want to combine
it with the document-level metadata. To do so, look at the `document_id`
value. This tells you which document the metadata belongs to.

For example, the first result in the `search_results` array ("Answer to the Ultimate
Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything, is 42.") has a `document_id`
value of `hitchhikers-guide` and has a `part_metadata` of `speaker:Deep Thought`, `lang:eng`,
`section:2`, and `offset:316`. These are the section-level metadata for this
result.

Because the `document_id` is `hitchhikers-guide`, we look at the first result in the
`search_results` array to find the document-level metadata and document ID.  In this
case, the `id` is `hitchhikers-guide` and the document-level metadata is
`author:Douglas Adams` and `publicationyear:1979`.

Depending on your use case, you might want to combine these metadata elements
together for display purposes.

## Filtering

You can also use the `document`- and `section`-level metadata to filter in a
search operation.  For more information on how to apply filter expressions at
either the document or section/part level, please see the
[filter expression](/docs/learn/metadata-search-filtering/filter-overview) documentation.
