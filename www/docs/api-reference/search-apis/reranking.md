Initial search results often fail to capture nuanced relevance or diversity, 
potentially leading to suboptimal user experiences. Utilizing Vectara's 
reranking can significantly enhance the quality and usefulness of 
search results, leading to more effective information retrieval. Reranking 
search results involves a process of rescoring and refining an initial set 
of query results to achieve a more precise ranking. It employs a machine 
learning model that while slower than the rapid retrieval step, offers more 
accurate results.

## Available rerankers

Vectara currently provides the following rerankers: 

* [**Multilingual Reranker v1**](/docs/learn/vectara-multi-lingual-reranker) (`type=customer_reranker` and `reranker_name=Rerank_Multilingual_v1`) 
  also known as Slingshot, provides more accurate neural ranking than the 
  initial Boomerang retrieval. While computationally more expensive, it offers 
  improved text scoring across   a wide range of languages, making it suitable 
  for diverse content.
* [**Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) Reranker**](/docs/learn/mmr-reranker) (`type=mmr`) 
  for diversifying results while maintaining relevance.
* [**User Defined Function Reranker**](/docs/learn/user-defined-function-reranker) (`type=userfn`) for 
  custom scoring based on metadata.

### Chain reranking

The Vectara Chain Reranker (`type=chain`) lets you combine multiple reranking 
strategies in sequence to meet more complex search requirements. This lets you 
completely customize the functionality of Vectara to your needs by giving you 
absolute control over the ranking functions. For details, see [Chain Reranker](/docs/learn/chain-reranker).

## Enable reranking

To enable reranking, specify the appropriate value for the `type` in the 
`reranker` object. For the MMR reranker, use `mmr`. In most scenarios, 
it makes sense to use the default query `start` value of `0` so that you're 
reranking all of the best initial results. You can also set the  `limit` of the 
`query` to the total number of documents you wish to rerank. The default value 
is `25`.

The following example shows the `limit` and `type` values in a query. Note that 
this simplified example intentionally omits several parameter values.

```json
{
  "query": "What is my question?",
  "stream_response": false,
  "search": {
    "start": 0,
    "limit": 25,
    "context_configuration": {},
    },
    "reranker": {
          "type": "mmr",
          "diversity_bias": "0.4"
    },
  "generation": [],
  "enable_factual_consistency_score": true
}
```


## Search cutoffs 

Sometimes you may want to exclude results that are not relevant to a 
query, and ensure that only results with higher scores than a specific 
threshold are displayed. The `cutoff` property of the `reranker` object allows 
you to specify a minimum score threshold for search results to include after 
reranking. 

By setting this cutoff value, you can control which results are considered 
relevant enough to return, filtering out results that do not meet the desired 
level of relevance. For example, when you set the `cutoff` to `0.5`, only results 
with a score of `0.5` or higher are considered. For example:

```json
"reranker": {
  "type": "customer_reranker",
  "reranker_name": "Rerank_Multilingual_v1",
  "cutoff": 0.5
}
```
When a reranker is applied with a cutoff, it performs the following steps:

1. Reranks all input results based on the selected reranker.
2. Applies the cutoff, removing any results with scores below the specified 
   threshold.
3. Returns the remaining results, sorted by their new scores.

:::note
This cutoff is applied per reranking stage. In a chain of rerankers, each 
reranker can have its own cutoff value, potentially further reducing the 
number of results at each stage. If both `limit` and `cutoff` are specified, the 
cutoff is applied first, followed by the limit.
:::

:::caution
Search cutoffs are most effective when used with neural rerankers like 
the Vectara Multilingual reranker (Slingshot). This provides normalized 
scores between 0 and 1. If you use hybrid search methods that involve BM25, 
scores may be unbounded, making cutoff values less predictable.
:::

## Search limits

The `limit` property of the `reranker` object allows you to have more 
granular control over the number of results returned after reranking. This 
limit is applied per each reranking stage, such as if you use chain reranking, 
and this limit affects the output and not the input to the reranker. 
When you apply this limit to the Multilingual reranker (Slingshot), Maximal 
Marginal Relevance (MMR) reranker, or User Defined Function reranker, it 
performs the following steps:

1. Applies score cutoff, if specified.
2. Reranks all input results based on the selected reranker.
3. Eliminates results that return null scores. Null scores are only returned 
   deliberately by the User Defined Function reranker. For example, you want 
   to eliminate some search results, have the UDF return null.
4. Sorts the reranked results based on their new scores.
5. Returns the top *N* results, where *N* is the value specified by this limit.

Imagine a scenario where you want to limit the output of results to a reranker, 
whether a single reranker, or within rerankers that are in a chain. For 
example, you want to process blog posts and ignore non-blog posts. You would 
set up a UDF to filter for blog categories and return null score for non-blog 
content. 

`if (get('$.document_metadata.category') == 'blog') get('$.score') else null`

This would remove non-blog posts from the results. Then you can set a 
limit of `10` to get only the top 10 blog post results.

## Combine cutoffs and limits

Using both cutoffs and limits in a chain allows for more refined control over 
query results. 

```json
{
  "reranker": {
    "type": "chain",
    "rerankers": [
      {
        "type": "userfn",
        "user_function": "if (get('$.document_metadata.category') == 'blog') get('$.score') else null",
        "limit": 10
      },
      {
        "type": "customer_reranker",
        "reranker_name": "Rerank_Multilingual_v1",
        "cutoff": 0.5,
        "limit": 3
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
This filters out non-blog content where the UDF reranker limits the output to 
10, and sends these 10 results to the Vectara Multilingual reranker which both 
removes results with a score below `0.5` and returns the top 3 results from 
the remaining set.


### Improve summarization

You can also improve LLM summarization by using cutoffs and limits. For 
example, filter out low-scoring results with a high threshold before sending 
them for summarization, which can improve the quality of the generated 
summary. This example uses both Slingshot and a User Defined Function to send 
only highly relevant and recent documents for summarization.

```json
"reranker": {
    "type": "chain",
    "rerankers": [
      {
        "type": "customer_reranker",
        "reranker_name": "Rerank_Multilingual_v1",
        "cutoff": 0.75,
        "limit": 10
      },
      {
        "type": "userfn",
        "user_function": "get('$.document_metadata.publish_ts')"
      }
    ]
  },
```

1. The first stage in the chain filters out documents with scores lower than 
   `0.75` and it also limits the results to `10`.
2. The next stage prioritizes documents based on their `publish_ts` value, 
   which represents the publication timestamp.

:::tip
You can also enable reranking in the Vectara console after navigating to the 
Query tab of a corpus and selecting **Retrieval**. Use this for exploration 
and experimenting with the API.
