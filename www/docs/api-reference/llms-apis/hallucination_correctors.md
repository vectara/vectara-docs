title: Correct Hallucinations API Definition
sidebar_label: Correct Hallucinations API Definition
---

The Hallucination Correctors API enables users to automatically 
detect and correct factual inaccuracies, commonly referred to as 
hallucinations, in generated summaries or responses. By comparing a 
user-provided summary against one or more source documents, the API returns a 
corrected version of the summary with minimal necessary edits.

Use this API to validate and improve the factual accuracy of summaries 
generated by LLMs in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, ensuring 
that the output remains grounded in trusted source content. If HCM does not 
detect hallucination, it preserves the original summary.

## Hallucination Correctors Request and Response Details

To correct a potentially hallucinated summary, send a `POST` request to 
`/v2/hallucination_correctors/correct_hallucinations`. The request body must include:
* `generated_text`: The generated text to evaluate and potentially correct.
* `documents`: One or more source documents containing the factual information that 
  the summary should be based on.
* `text`: The full content of a source document.
* `model_name`: The name of the LLM model to use for hallucination correction.
* `query`: (Optional) The original user query that led to the generated text. 
  This helps improve accuracy by giving the model additional 
  context about the user's intent and expected output format. It works well 
  with the `vhc-large-1.0` model.


### Example request

This example provides a summary about a historical event.

```json
{
  "summary": "The Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1920, officially ending World War I. 
  It was primarily negotiated by France, Britain, Italy, and Japan.",
  "documents": [
    {
      "text": "The Treaty of Versailles was signed on June 28, 1919. The United States 
      played a major role, represented by President Woodrow Wilson.",
    }
  ],
  "model": "vhc-small-1.0",
}
```

### Example response

The response corrects the original summary.

```json
{
  "original_text": "The Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1920, officially ending World War I. 
  It was primarily negotiated by France, Britain, Italy, and Japan.",
  "corrected_text": "The Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1919, officially ending World War I. 
  It was primarily negotiated by France, Britain, Italy, and the United States."
}
```

If the input summary is accurate, the `corrected_summary` matches the `original_summary`.

### Error responses

* **400 Bad Request** – The request body was malformed or contained invalid 
  parameters. This can occur if you use `model` instead of the required `model_name` 
  parameter.
* **403 Forbidden** – The user does not have permission to perform factual 
  consistency evaluation.
