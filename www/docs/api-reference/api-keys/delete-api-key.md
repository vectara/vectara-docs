The Delete API Key API lets you delete one or more existing API keys.
This capability is useful for managing the lifecycle and security of API keys
such as when they are no longer needed or when a key is compromised.

## Delete API Key Request and Response

To delete an API key, send a DELETE request to `/v2/api_keys/{api_key_id}`,
where `{api_key_id}` is the ID of the API key you want to delete.
