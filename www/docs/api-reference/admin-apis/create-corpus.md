The [Create Corpus API](/docs/rest-api/create-corpus) lets you create a corpus to store and manage your
documents. A corpus is a container for documents and their associated
metadata. When creating a corpus, you can specify various settings such as the
corpus key, name, description, encoder, and filter attributes.

## Corpus Object

When you create a `corpus` object, the `key` property is required to uniquely
identify the corpus. The `name` parameter is optional and defaults to the
value of `key`. The optional `description` properties lets you provide
additional information about the corpus.

You can specify whether to treat queries or documents in the corpus as
questions or answers using the `queries_are_answers` and `documents_are_questions`
boolean properties. These settings affect the semantics of the encoder used at
query time and indexing time.

The `encoder_name` property allows you to choose the encoder for the corpus. If
not specified, it defaults to the latest Vectara encoder.

:::note
The `encoder_id` property has been deprecated. Use the `encoder_name` 
property instead.

In order to reference metadata in [filter expressions](/docs/learn/metadata-search-filtering/filter-overview), the attributes
are declared at creation time in the `filter_attributes` array. You can add, 
edit, and remove filter attributes from the [Console UI](/docs/console-ui/creating-a-corpus) in the Corpora Settings, 
or with the [Replace Filters Attributes API definition](/docs/api-reference/admin-apis/corpus/replace-filter-attributes).

Scale users can specify `custom_dimensions` to allow weighting of document parts
during indexing and querying. Like filter attributes, custom dimensions cannot
be changed after corpus creation.

The response message returns a unique `id` that you use to reference the
corpus. The `name` does not need to be unique within an account.

For information on **custom dimensions**, a Scale-only feature, please see
[Custom Dimensions](/docs/learn/semantic-search/add-custom-dimensions).
Custom dimensions cannot be changed after the corpus
is created.

## Filter Attribute

In order to reference metadata in [filter expressions](/docs/learn/metadata-search-filtering/filter-overview), the
referenceable attributes must be declared at creation time in the **filter
attributes**. This list cannot be changed once the corpus is created.

Filter attributes allow you to attach metadata to your data at the document (`doc`) 
or `part` level, which you can use later in filter expressions to narrow the scope 
of your queries.

A filter attribute must specify a unique `name` (up to 64 characters long), and 
a `level` which indicates whether it exists in the `doc` or `part` level 
metadata. At indexing time, metadata with this name is extracted and made 
available for filter expressions to operate on.

### Doc and Part Filter Levels

The `doc` attribute applies to the entire document. Use this for metadata that 
is consistent across the whole document, such as author, publication date, and 
document ID.

The `part` attribute applies to specific sections or chunks within a document. 
Use for metadata that may vary within different parts of the document, such as 
sections, page numbers, and sentiment scores.

If `indexed` is true, the system will build an index on the extracted values
to further improve the performance of filter expressions involving the
attribute.

Filter attributes must specify a `type`, which is validated when
documents are indexed. The four supported types are `integer`, which stores
signed whole-number values up to eight bytes in length; `real`, for storing
floating point values in [IEEE 754 8-byte format][1]; `text` for storing
textual strings in [UTF-8 encoding][2], and `boolean` for storing true/false
values.

After you define filter attributes, you can use them within your queries. For example:

* Document-level attribute: `doc.publication_year > 2020`
* Part-level attribute: `part.sentiment_score > 0.7`

## REST 2.0 URL

### Create Corpus REST 2.0 Endpoint

<Config v="names.product"/> exposes a REST endpoint at the following URL
to create a corpus:
<code>https://<Config v="domains.rest.admin"/>/v2/corpora</code>

The API Reference shows the full [Create Corpus](/docs/rest-api/create-corpus) REST definition.

## gRPC Example

You can find the full Create Corpus gRPC definition at [admin.proto](https://github.com/vectara/protos/blob/main/admin.proto).

The `CreateCorpusRequest` message contains a Corpus message with the name,
description, and other customization options. The `CreateCorpusResponse`
provides the response with the new Corpus ID and status.
