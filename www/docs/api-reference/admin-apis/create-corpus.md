## Endpoint Address

<Config v="names.product"/> exposes a REST endpoint at the following URL
to ingest content into a corpus:
<code>https://<Config v="domains.rest.admin"/>/v1/create-corpus</code>
This page describes the details of interacting with this endpoint.

Only the `name` and `description` fields are mandatory when creating a corpus.
The response message returns a unique id, `corpus_id`, by which the corpus can
be subsequently referenced. Note that the name needn't be unique within an
account.

In order to reference metadata in [filter expressions](/docs/common-use-cases/filtering-by-metadata/filter-overview), the
referenceable attributes must be declared at creation time in the **filter
attributes**. This list cannot be changed once the corpus is created.

For information on **custom dimensions** please see
[Custom Dimensions](/docs/common-use-cases/semantic-search/custom_dimensions.md).
Like filter attributes, custom dimensions cannot be changed after the corpus is created.

```protobuf
message CreateCorpusRequest {
  Corpus corpus = 1;
}

message CreateCorpusResponse {
  // The corpus id that was created.
  uint32 corpus_id = 1;
  Status status = 2;
}

message Corpus {
  // The corpus id.
  uint32 id = 1;
  // The name of the corpus.
  string name = 2;
  // A description for the corpus.
  string description = 3;
  // The time at which the corpus was provisioned.
  int64 dt_provision = 4;
  // Whether the corpus is enabled for use or not.
  bool enabled = 5;

  
  bool swap_qenc = 6;
  // The default query encoder is designed for normal question-answering types
  // of queries when the text contains the answer.  Swapping the index encoder
  // is generally rare, but can be used to help directly match questions to
  // questions.  This can be useful if you have a FAQ dataset and you want to
  // directly match the user question to the question in the FAQ.
  bool swap_ienc = 7;
  // When a corpus is "textless", Vectara does not store the original text.
  // Instead, Vectara converts the text to vectors and only retains metadata.
  bool textless = 8;
  // Encryption is on by default and cannot be turned off.
  bool encrypted = 9;

  // This is an advanced setting for changing the underlying model type.  The
  // default value is "1", which is Vectara's high-performing global model.
  // Underlying models may be swapped for some paying customers by contacting
  // our support team.
  uint64 encoder_id = 10;
  // An optional maximum size of the metadata that each document can contain.
  uint32 metadata_max_bytes = 11;

#### Filter Attribute

A filter attribute must specify a **name**, and a **level** which indicates
whether it exists in the document or part level metadata. At indexing time,
metadata with this name will be extracted and made available for filter
expressions to operate on.

If **indexed** is true, the system will build an index on the extracted values
to further improve the performance of filter expressions involving the
attribute.

Finally, filter attributes must specify a **type**, which is validated when
documents are indexed. The four supported types are **integer**, which stores
signed whole-number values up to eight bytes in length; **real**, for storing
floating point values in [IEEE 754 8-byte format][1]; **text** for storing
textual strings in [UTF-8 encoding][2], and **boolean** for storing true/false
values.
