The Delete User API lets you delete a user from the account.

## Delete User Request and Response

To delete a user, send a DELETE request to `/v2/users/{username}`, where `{username}`
is the User ID of the user you want to delete.

The response contains the `204` status code that indicates the user has been
successfully deleted.
