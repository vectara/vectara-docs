The Manage User endpoint lets you perform different user and team management 
activities such as adding, deleting, enabling, disabling, and editing user 
roles. This capability is useful in scenarios that require dynamic team 
management.

For example, a company wants to onboard new team members efficiently and this  
endpoint lets you streamline the onboarding process by programatically 
adding new users, assigning appropriate roles, and setting up access 
permissions.
