The Delete Corpus API lets you delete a corpus and all the data it contains.
To delete a corpus, send a DELETE request to `/v2/corpora/:corpus_key`, where
`corpus_key` is the unique identifier of the corpus.

Upon successful completion, space quota consumed by the corpus will be freed,
and the corpus will no longer be useable for future indexing or querying.

:::note

The corpus_key assigned to the corpus will be released and can be reused.
