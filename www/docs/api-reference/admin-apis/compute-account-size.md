The Compute Account Size endpoint lets you view how much quota you consumed 
across the entire account. This capability is useful for administrators who 
want to track and monitor usage of multiple accounts. For example, you manage 
multiple tenants and notice that your account usage is higher than expected.

You use the [Compute Corpus Size API](/docs/api-reference/admin-apis/corpus/compute-corpus-size) to determine 
that a tenant is over their quota. You decide to revoke the ability for 
the tenant to add more data to the corpus or perform more searches by 
disabling API keys.

:::tip

Check out our [**interactive API Playground**](/docs/rest-api/compute-account-size) that lets you experiment with this 
endpoint to view the account size.

## Compute Account Size Request and Response

:::note

The request to compute the account size is an expensive operation.

This request requires the Customer ID parameter. The response includes a `size` 
object which is the sum of the number of 
characters and metadata characters.
