The Corpus Size endpoint lets you view detailed information about corpora 
within your account. It enables you to view different aspects about the corpus 
including basic information like the ID, name, whether it is enabled or 
disabled, and other metadata. You can also view the corpus size, associated 
API keys, custom dimensions, and filter attributes.
