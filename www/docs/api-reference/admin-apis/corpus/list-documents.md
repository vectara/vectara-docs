The List Documents API enables you to retrieve a list of documents stored in a 
specific corpus. This endpoint provides an overview of document metadata, 
including document IDs, tables (if table extraction is enabled), and 
pagination details. This is useful for viewing documents indexed so far and 
helping you decide to remove documents that are no longer needed. It helps you 
manage the document lifecycle in your environment.

This information enables you to catalog and inventory large amounts of data 
while also extracting lists of documents for further analysis. For example, 
developers can utilize the metadata to to build custom search and filtering 
capabilities into their applications. If you enabled tabled extraction, this 
endpoint also returns the tables that this document contains.

Currently Document Admin APIs do not allow you to access the text of
your documents.

## List Documents Request and Response

To list documents, send a GET request to `/v2/corpora/:corpus_key/documents`,
where `corpus_key` is the unique identifier for the corpus. You can specify
optional query parameters to control the pagination of the results.

- `limit` - Indicates the maximum number of documents to return in a single
  request, with a default value of `10` and a maximum value of `100`.
- `metadata_filter` - Filters documents on document metadata by accepting a 
  metadata filter expression similar to those used in query operations, but 
  limited to document-level metadata.
- `page_key` - Retrieves the next page of results when the previous request
  has reached the limit.

The response contains an array of `document` objects with the matching
document IDs, metadata, tables, parts, storage usage, and metadata about the 
pagination.
