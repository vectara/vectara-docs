The List Documents API lets you view the Document IDs and their metadata
in a corpus. This is useful for viewing documents indexed so far and helping
you decide to remove documents that are no longer needed. It helps you manage
the document lifecycle in your enviroment.

This information enables you to catalog and inventory large amounts of data
while also extracting lists of documents for further analysis. For example,
developers can utilize the metadata to to build custom search and filtering
capabilities into their applications.

Currently Document Admin APIs do not allow you to access the text of
your documents.

## List Documents Request and Response

To list documents, send a GET request to `/v2/corpora/:corpus_key/documents`,
where `corpus_key` is the unique identifier for the corpus. You can specify
optional query parameters to control the pagination of the results.

- `limit` - Indicates the maximum number of documents to return in a single
  request, with a default value of `10` and a maximum value of `100`.
- `page_key` - Retrieves the next page of results when the previous request
  has reached the limit.

The response contains an array of `document` objects with the matching
documents and metadata about the pagination.
