The Compute Corpus Size endpoint lets you view the amount of quota consumed 
by a corpus. This capability is useful for administrators to track and monitor 
the amount of usage for specific corpora. For example, you manage multiple 
tenants and determine that a user consumed too much quota and you might decide 
to disable the API keys associated with a specific corpus or corpora.

Check out our [**interactive API Playground**](/docs/rest-api/compute-corpus-size) that lets you experiment with this 
endpoint to compute the corpus size.
