The Delete Turns API deletes specific turns from chat. This enables developers
to remove inaccurate or inappropriate responses from the conversation history.

The `chat_id` specifies the conversation ID that contains the turn
you want to delete, and the `turn_id` specifies the Turn ID that you want to
delete.
