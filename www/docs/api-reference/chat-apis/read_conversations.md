The Read Conversations API retrieves detailed information about specific
conversations and chat interactions. This information enables developers to
analyze the flow of user chats and understand the context of interactions,
which helps in refining chatbot responses. You can read up to 100
conversations.

The `conversation_id` specifies the ID of the conversation that you want to read,
and it retrieves the `Conversation` object. This object has an `id` and `turn`
object which includes the `id` of the turn, `conversationId`, the `query` text,
`answer`, and whether the turn is `enabled`.

## REST Example

### Read Conversations Endpoint Address

<Config v="names.product"/> exposes an HTTP endpoint at the following URL
to read conversations in the chat history corpus:
<code>https://<Config v="domains.rest.indexing"/>/v2/chats/:chat_id/turns</code>

The API Reference shows the full [Read Conversations](/docs/rest-api/list-chat-turns) REST definition.
