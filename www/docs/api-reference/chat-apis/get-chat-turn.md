The Get Chat Turn API allows you to retrieve a specific turn from a chat,
which represents a message and response pair in the conversation.

## Get Chat Turn Request and Response

To get a chat turn, send a GET request to `/v2/chats/{chat_id}/turns/{turn_id}`,
where `{chat_id}` is the unique identifier of the chat and `{turn_id}` is the
unique identifier of the turn within that chat. Note that both `chat_id` and
`turn_id` values were returned when the chat and turn were created.

The response contains an array of `turn` id, chat_id, query, answer, enabled
status, and created_at timestamp.
