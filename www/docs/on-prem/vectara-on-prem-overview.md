A private deployment of Vectara brings the full power of our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) platform directly into your controlled environment. This deployment option enables organizations to leverage cutting-edge AI technology while maintaining complete control over their data, infrastructure, and security posture.

## Why choose a private deployment?

Your data never leaves your infrastructure. All processing, storage, and computation occurs within your controlled environment, ensuring compliance with the strictest data residency requirements.

### Enhanced security and compliance
Meet regulatory requirements for industries such as finance, healthcare, defense, and government. Private deployment supports air-gapped deployments and integrates with your existing security controls and compliance frameworks.
