LangFlow is a leading open-source no-code platform for building LLM-powered 
applications. Similar to [Flowise](/docs/integrations/vectara-and-flowise), it provides a quick way to build RAG flows 
with minimal or no coding required. The main difference is that Flowise is 
based on Javascript, whereas LangFlow is in Python.

You can grab the Vectara RAG component from the [LangFlow store](https://www.langflow.store/) and start using 
it in minutes.

## Integration benefits

* Allows rapid development of RAG flows with minimal or no coding.
* Provides a Vectara RAG component in the LangFlow store for quick integration.
* Enables easy access to Vectara's semantic search and RAG capabilities.
