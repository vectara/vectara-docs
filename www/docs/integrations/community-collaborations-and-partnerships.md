In collaboration with the larger GenAI community, Vectara integrates with 
other systems to empower developers to enhance their AI applications. 
Vectara's advanced capabilities in document indexing and neural retrieval can 
help unlock new possibilities for improving search accuracy and AI-driven 
applications.

The integrations fall into a few categories:
1. **Ingest tools:** our integrations with Airbyte, Unstructured and DataVolo 
   empower developers to build their data ingest pipeline that continuously 
   updates their data assets in the Vectara corpus using these offerings, which 
   offer off-the-shelf integration with hundreds of data sources.
2. **LLM orchestration:** for developers that are already building with LangChain 
   or LlamaIndex, Vectara is fully integrated to enable efficient and low-latency 
   RAG that can plug into your GenAI application.
3. **Drag-and-drop App builders:** Vectara is fully integrated with both Flowise 
   and LangFlow, two of the leading products offering a no-code / drag-and-drop 
   interface for building LLM applications.

:::note
These third-party integrations are not officially supported by Vectara. Users 
may need to seek community support or external resources for assistance and 
updates.
