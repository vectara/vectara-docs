DataVolo, powered by Apache NiFi, is designed for continuous, event-driven 
ingest that can scale up on demand to cope with bursts of high-volume data, 
making the job of the data engineer far easier due to some core design 
principles.

## Integration benefits

* Provides a data-engineer friendly data ingest flow.
* Offers modular, flexible, and robust data ingestion.
* Supports high-volume data bursts with on-demand scaling.
