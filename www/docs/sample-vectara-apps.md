Explore the <Config v="names.product"/> platform through various 
demo applications that demonstrates the power of GenAI conversational 
search and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). 

![Vectara Demos](/img/vectara-demos.gif)

We provide several open source <Config v="names.product"/> applications to help 
inspire developer creativity.


* [**Ask Docker**](https://docker-docs.demo.vectara.com/) questions about the Docker 
  documentation.
* [**Ask LangChain Docs**](https://langchain-docs.demo.vectara.com/) questions about 
  LangChain from their documentation.
* [**Ask LlamaIndex Docs**](https://llamaindex-docs.demo.vectara.com/) questions 
  about LlamaIndex from their documentation.
* [**Ask Harvard Business School**](https://askhbs.demo.vectara.com/) questions 
  about their institution.
* [**AskNews**](https://asknews.demo.vectara.com) lets you ask questions about news 
  events around the world and get accurate answers.
* [**Vectara Ingest**](https://github.com/vectara/vectara-ingest) crawls datasets 
  from pre-built crawlers (websites, RSS feeds, Jira, Notion, Docusaurus) and 
  ingests them into <Config v="names.product"/>.
* [**Vectara Answer**](https://github.com/vectara/vectara-answer) enables users to create 
  custom conversational search applications, such as chatbots, semantic search, 
  and workplace search by connecting to your ingested data.
    
    This project provides example code for a modern user-interface 
    for <Config v="names.product"/> GenAI conversational search.
