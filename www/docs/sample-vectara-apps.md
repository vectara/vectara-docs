The <Config v="names.product"/> platform enables you to build generative AI and Retrieval 
Augmented Generation (RAG) applications quickly and without expertise in AI or 
ML concepts. We have a diverse set of open-source demo applications that 
showcase the power of generative AI applications for realistic use cases. 
These demo applications are just a sample of what developers can create with 
<Config v="names.product"/>.

Our demo applications cover a variety of use cases that address known industry  
challenges. They include question-answering tools for documentation support,  
AI agents for complex tasks, chatbots that use conversational search for  
real-time interactions, virtual agents that automate workflows, and custom  
data ingestion tools for integrating RAG capabilities into an existing  
application. Each demo serves as a practical example to inspire developers  
to build AI-enhanced solutions for their specific use cases.
