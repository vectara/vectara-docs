The <Config v="names.product"/> platform enables you to build generative AI and Retrieval 
Augmented Generation (RAG) applications quickly and without expertise in AI or 
ML concepts. We have a diverse set of open-source demo applications that 
showcase the power of generative AI applications for realistic use cases. 
These demo applications are just a sample of what developers can create 
with <Config v="names.product"/>.

We built demos for financial, news, legal, medical, and more use cases. Each 
demo serves as a practical example to inspire developers to build AI-enhanced 
solutions for their specific use cases. For example, [Financial assistant](https://huggingface.co/spaces/vectara/finance-assistant) 
answers questions based on financial reports of public companys. [AskNews](https://asknews.demo.vectara.com/) 
lets you ask questions about news events around the world. 

For a current list, see [Demo applications](https://www.vectara.com/developers/build/demos).
