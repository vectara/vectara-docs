Discover the <Config v="names.product"/> platform's potential with our diverse collection of 
open-source demo applications. These examples showcase the power of generative 
AI applications and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in action, 
inspiring developers to innovate and integrate cutting-edge capabilities into 
their own solutions.

Our demo collection spans a range of applications designed to solve various 
industry challenges. From question-answering tools that provide precise 
documentation support, to advanced AI agents which demonstrate agentic 
capabilities for handling complex tasks, these applications cater to diverse 
developer needs.

Explore chatbots that leverage conversational search for real-time 
interactions, virtual agents that automate workflows, and custom 
data ingestion tools that simplify integrating RAG capabilities. Each demo 
serves as a practical example to inspire developers to build robust, 
AI-enhanced solutions tailored to their unique use cases.
