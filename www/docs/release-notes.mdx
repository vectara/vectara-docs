## UI Enhancement: Custom Prompts in Console

_August 20, 2024_

The Vectara Prompt Engine allows users to create customized prompt templates 
that can reference relevant text and metadata for Retrieval Augmented 
Generation (RAG) applications.

Why it matters: This feature enables more advanced workflows and 
customizations for creating context-aware responses, such as answering 
questions based on previous answers in RFIs or RFPs, drafting support tickets 
from user feedback, and customizing result formatting. The ability to define 
roles and provide detailed context in prompts helps guide LLMs to generate 
more accurate and relevant responses.

## User Defined Function Reranking

_August 15, 2024_

Vectara introduces the User Defined Function Reranker, giving enterprises more 
granular control over search result ordering by defining custom reranking 
functions using document-level metadata, part-level metadata, or scores 
generated from the request-level metadata. This flexibility is particularly 
useful for a wide range of use cases.

**Why it matters:** This feature allows enterprises to modify scores based on 
metadata, conditions, and custom logic, in order to craft highly tailored 
search experiences. This advanced functionality can guide LLMs to prioritize 
certain information, especially when used with the chain reranker. Use cases 
can include recency bias for news searches, location bias for local business 
queries, and e-commerce bias for promotional content.

## Vectara REST API v2

_June 6, 2024_

The Vectara API v2 provides a more RESTful, intuitive structure with simpler 
authentication, new top-level objects, and better defaults for hybrid search 
and reranking, making it easier to develop applications with Vectara’s GenAI 
platform.

**Why it matters:** This update significantly improves the developer 
experience, making it easier to integrate Vectara into applications. The 
standardized error codes and improved defaults reduce development overhead 
and potential silent errors. While REST API v2 is a major improvement, Vectara 
continues to support gRPC for low-latency applications

## Vectara Multilingual Reranker v1 (Slingshot)

_May 28, 2024_

The state-of-the-art Vectara Multilingual Reranker, also known as Slingshot, 
provides more accurate neural ranking than the initial Boomerang retrieval. 
By significantly improving the precision of retrieved search results, 
Slingshot enhances the performance of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) 
pipelines. It excels in globally distributed, multilingual environments, 
reducing irrelevant responses and minimizing hallucinations in generative 
AI applications.

**Why it matters:** Slingshot significantly enhances the precision of retrieved 
results, crucial for reducing hallucinations and irrelevant responses in 
generative AI applications. While computationally more expensive, it offers 
improved text scoring across a wide range of languages (100+), making it 
suitable for diverse content as a powerful tool for enterprises.

**Deprecated:** The `reranker_id` and `rnk_272725719` have been deprecated. 
Use `reranker_name` and `Rerank_Multilingual_v1` instead.

## Semantic Conversation History Search​

_May 15, 2024_

Vectara now allows administrators to search across conversation logs for 
specific patterns or unresolved queries. This leverages semantic search 
capabilities to identify gaps in knowledge bases and pinpoint "unknown 
unknowns" in conversations where users may have asked unexpected or 
unresolved questions.

**Why it matters:** With this capability, enterprises can enhance their customer 
support by analyzing user interactions and improving response accuracy. They 
can identify unresolved or ambiguous user questions, even if the language is 
informal or the question does not fit specific patterns.

Vectara now allows users to format citations in summaries using Markdown or 
HTML and including document and part level metadata directly in citation 
links. This feature is useful for enterprises that require formatted, 
context-rich summaries for integrating generative responses into web-based 
applications and ensuring citations are clear and appropriately formatted.

**Why it matters:** By allowing structured citations, Vectara simplifies the 
integration process for developers who need to embed references directly into 
user-facing applications without additional parsing logic. This improvement 
enhances usability for various platforms, including web-based content and 
internal systems that support HTML or Markdown.
