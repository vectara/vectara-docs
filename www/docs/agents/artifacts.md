Artifacts give an agent access to files and documents without storing them in 
a corpus. You upload artifacts to a session for temporary use, and the agent 
uses these files during the conversation. This lets you analyze documents 
on-the-fly without permanently indexing them into a corpus.

## Working with artifacts in sessions

Sessions provide a workspace where agents can access and process files uploaded 
by users or generated by tools. These files are stored as artifacts that enable 
efficient file handling without bloating the agent's context.

To make files available to an agent, upload them to the session workspace using 
a multipart request. Files are stored as artifacts and can be referenced 
throughout the conversation.

After files are uploaded as artifacts, the agent can extract content from PDFs,
Word documents, or PowerPoint files and reference artifacts during 
conversations. Artifacts remain available throughout the session lifecycle, 
enabling multi-step workflows without re-uploading files.

:::tip Tip
Artifacts only stay attached to their specific session. If you want these 
artifacts in a corpus, use the index tool to add them.

### Uploading files to a session

To make files available to an agent, upload them to the session workspace using
a multipart request. Files are stored as artifacts and can be referenced
throughout the conversation.

<CodePanel
  title="Upload files to session"
  snippets={[
    {
      language: 'bash',
      code: `curl -X POST https://api.vectara.io/v2/agents/{agent_key}/sessions/{session_key}/upload \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \\
  -F "file=@report.pdf" \\
  -F "file=@analysis.docx"`
    }
  ]}
  annotations={{
    bash: [
      { line: 1, text: 'Upload endpoint for session artifacts' },
      { line: 3, text: 'Attach first file' },
      { line: 4, text: 'Attach additional files in same request' }
    ]
  }}
  layout="stacked"
/>

The response contains an `ArtifactUploadEvent` with references to all uploaded
files. This event becomes part of the session history, making the agent aware
of the available files:

    }

## List artifacts in a session.

View what is currently stored in a session's workspace:

  snippets={[
    {
      language: 'curl',
      code: `curl -X GET "https://api.vectara.io/v2/agents/{agent_key}/sessions/{session_key}/artifacts"
       -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"`
    }
  ]}

## Retrieve content of an artifact

Download an artifact (including agent-generated ones).

<CodePanel
  title="List artifacts in a session"
  snippets={[
    {
      language: 'curl',
      code: `curl -X GET "https://api.vectara.io/v2/agents/{agent_key}/sessions/{session_key}/artifacts/{artifact_id}" 
       -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"`
    }
  ]}
  layout="stacked"
/>

### How agents use artifacts

After files are uploaded as artifacts, the agent can:
- Use document conversion tools to extract content from PDFs, Word documents,
  or PowerPoint files.
- Reference artifacts in analysis or question-answering workflows.
- Pass artifacts to indexing tools to add content to corpora.
- Create new artifacts as outputs of tool operations.

Artifacts remain available throughout the session lifecycle, enabling multi-step
workflows without re-uploading files.
