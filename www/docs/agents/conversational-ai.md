Build conversational AI without having to choose between accuracy and ease of 
use. Without requiring a team of AI professionals, Vectara offers you a 
ready-to-deploy solution producing virtual assistants founded on your own data. 
You can build AI assistants that remember context 
and provide personalized help throughout the conversation.

## Why select Vectara for conversational AI?

Vectara addresses the actual challenges enterprises encounter when creating 
conversational experiences:

- **Deploy quickly**: Launch in days, not months, using pre-built features.
- **Give trusted responses**: Agents pull answers from your data rather than 
  general internet training.
- **Maintain enterprise governance**: Acquire the necessary security, compliance, and 
  control for your enterprise.
- **Simplify**: Concentrate on what your clients want rather than controlling AI 
  infrastructure.

## How Vectara's conversational AI works

Vectara's Conversational AI lets you use **Agents** that do the thinking by 
following your instructions for how to respond, using the appropriate tools 
to assist and knowing what consumers want. You chat with the agent which 
follows the dialogue and recalls what was said in the conversation. This makes 
interactions feel natural and consistent.

You can create the following types of conversational AI experiences:

### Self-service banking assistants

Give your customers 24/7 support through natural conversation for checking 
balances, reviewing transactions, and managing their accounts.

### Support bots for engineering teams

Help your engineers find technical docs and specifications faster by letting 
them ask questions naturally instead of digging through documentation.

### Department-specific agents

Set up specialized assistants for sales, HR, IT support, or any team that needs 
quick access to department-specific knowledge with proper access controls.
