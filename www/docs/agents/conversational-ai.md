Build conversational AI without having to choose between accuracy and ease of 
use. Without requiring a team of AI professionals, Vectara offers you a 
ready-to-deploy solution producing virtual assistants founded on your own data. 
Use Agents with session management to build assistants that remember context 
and provide personalized help throughout the conversation.

## Why select Vectara for conversational AI?

Vectara addresses the actual challenges enterprises encounter when creating 
conversational experiences:

- **Deploy quickly**: Launch in days, not months, using pre-built features.
- **Give trusted responses**: Agents pull answers from your data rather than 
  general internet training.
- **Maintain enterprise governance**: Acquire the necessary security, compliance, and 
  control for your enterprise.
- **Simplify**: Concentrate on what your clients want rather than controlling AI 
  infrastructure.

## How Vectara's conversational AI works

Vectara's Conversational AI combines **Agents** and **Chat APIs** to provide 
natural, context-aware chats in your applications.

- **Agents** do the thinking by following your instructions for how to respond, 
  using the appropriate tools to assist and knowing what consumers want.
- **Chat APIs** follow the dialogue and recall what was said in the conversation 
  to make interactions feel natural and consistent.

## What you can build

### Self-service banking assistants
Give your customers 24/7 support through natural conversation for checking 
balances, reviewing transactions, and managing their accounts.

### Support bots for engineering teams
Help your engineers find technical docs and specifications faster by letting 
them ask questions naturally instead of digging through documentation.

### Department-specific agents
Set up specialized assistants for sales, HR, IT support, or any team that needs 
quick access to department-specific knowledge with proper access controls.


## Enterprise governance and security

Every Vectara agent includes enterprise-grade security and governance:

- **Complete audit trails**: Track every agent interaction and decision.
- **Role-based access control**: Control who can access specific data and capabilities.
- **Data privacy**: Your content is never used to train models.
- **Compliance certification**: SOC 2 and HIPAA certified to meet industry standards.
- **Decision transparency**: See exactly how agents arrive at their responses.
