sidebar_label: Model Context Protocol
---

import CodePanel from '@site/src/theme/CodePanel';

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an revolutionary open standard that acts 
as a "USB-C port for AI applications," providing a standardized way to connect 
Large Language Models (LLMs) to diverse data sources, tools, and enterprise 
systems. Created by Anthropic and adopted broadly across the AI ecosystem, MCP 
enables seamless, secure, and scalable interactions between AI agents and the 
complex infrastructure that powers modern businesses.

### Core MCP concepts

**Standardized Integration**: MCP eliminates the need for custom integrations by providing a universal protocol that any AI system can use to access external capabilities. Instead of building point-to-point connections between each AI tool and data source, MCP creates a standardized interface that works across different LLM providers and enterprise systems.

**Client-Server Architecture**: MCP follows a clean client-server model where:
- **MCP Hosts** are programs that want to access external data and tools
- **MCP Clients** maintain protocol connections and handle communication
- **MCP Servers** are lightweight programs that expose specific capabilities
- **Data Sources** can be local (files, databases) or remote (APIs, cloud services)

**Tool and Resource Abstraction**: MCP provides two primary abstraction layers:
- **Tools**: Actions that agents can perform (search databases, send emails, create tickets)
- **Resources**: Information sources that agents can access (documents, customer records, system status)

## How Vectara agents use MCP

Vectara's agentic platform leverages MCP as the foundational protocol for enterprise tool integration, creating a powerful ecosystem where AI agents can seamlessly access and manipulate business-critical systems while maintaining security and governance controls.

## MCP Best Practices for Enterprise Deployment

### Security and Governance

**1. Authentication and Authorization**
```json
{
  "server_config": {
    "authentication": {
      "type": "oauth2",
      "client_id": "${ENTERPRISE_CLIENT_ID}",
      "client_secret": "${ENTERPRISE_CLIENT_SECRET}",
      "scope": ["read:customers", "write:tickets"]
    },
    "authorization": {
      "role_based_access": true,
      "resource_permissions": ["crm:read", "support:write"]
    }
  }
}
```

**2. Data Classification and Handling**
- Implement automatic data classification for sensitive information
- Use encryption in transit and at rest for all MCP communications
- Apply data retention policies based on enterprise requirements
- Ensure GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulatory compliance

**3. Audit and Monitoring**
```json
{
  "audit_config": {
    "log_all_requests": true,
    "include_parameters": true,
    "retention_days": 2555,
    "compliance_framework": ["SOX", "GDPR"],
    "alert_on_sensitive_access": true
  }
}
```

### Performance and Reliability

**1. Connection Management**
- Use connection pooling to minimize overhead
- Implement circuit breakers for failing MCP servers
- Set appropriate timeouts for different tool types
- Monitor and alert on connection health

**2. Error Handling and Resilience**
```python
# Example error handling pattern
class MCPToolExecutor:
    def execute_tool(self, tool_name, parameters):
        try:
            result = self.mcp_client.call_tool(tool_name, parameters)
            return self.validate_result(result)
        except MCPConnectionError:
            return self.handle_connection_failure(tool_name)
        except MCPTimeoutError:
            return self.handle_timeout(tool_name, parameters)
        except MCPValidationError as e:
            return self.handle_validation_error(e)
```

**3. Schema Management**
- Validate all tool schemas during server registration
- Implement version compatibility checking
- Cache schemas for performance optimization
- Handle schema evolution gracefully

### Development and Operations

**1. MCP Server Development Standards**
```yaml
mcp_server_standards:
  naming_conventions:
    tools: "verb_noun format (e.g., search_customers)"
    parameters: "snake_case with clear descriptions"
  
  documentation:
    required_fields: ["description", "parameters", "examples"]
    schema_validation: "JSON Schema v7 minimum"
  
  testing:
    unit_tests: "All tool functions"
    integration_tests: "End-to-end workflows"
    performance_tests: "Response time benchmarks"
```

**2. Deployment and Configuration**
- Use infrastructure as code for MCP server deployments
- Implement blue-green deployments for zero-downtime updates
- Configure monitoring and alerting for all MCP endpoints
- Establish clear rollback procedures

**3. Tool Design Principles**
- **Single Responsibility**: Each tool should have one clear purpose
- **Idempotency**: Tools should be safe to retry
- **Parameter Validation**: Strict input validation and clear error messages
- **Output Consistency**: Standardized response formats across similar tools

## MCP Architecture Patterns for Enterprise Scale

### Microservices Pattern

Implement MCP servers as microservices for scalability and maintainability:

```yaml
architecture:
  mcp_gateway:
    role: "Central routing and authentication"
    responsibilities: ["auth", "routing", "rate_limiting"]
  
  specialized_servers:
    crm_server:
      tools: ["customer_search", "opportunity_lookup", "contact_management"]
      scaling: "horizontal with load balancer"
    
    analytics_server:
      tools: ["generate_report", "query_metrics", "create_dashboard"]
      scaling: "vertical for compute-intensive operations"
    
    workflow_server:
      tools: ["create_ticket", "approve_request", "send_notification"]
      scaling: "event-driven with queue processing"
```
