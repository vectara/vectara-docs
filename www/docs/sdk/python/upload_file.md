This guide demonstrates how to upload files (PDFs, DOCX, and more) to a 
Vectara corpus using the Python SDK. Uploaded files are automatically parsed, 
chunked, and indexedâ€”making their contents instantly available for search 
and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

Use file upload for:
- Bulk onboarding of policy docs, technical manuals, invoices, contracts, or 
  research papers
- Ingesting new content as soon as it is generated by your business
- Processing documents with tables, charts, and structured data

## Prerequisites

<CodePanel
  title="Install Vectara SDK"
  snippets={[
    { language: 'bash', code: `pip install vectara` }
  ]}
  customWidth="50%"
/>

**Setup Requirements:**
1. **Install the SDK** with `pip install vectara`
2. **Get an API key** from the [Vectara Console](https://console.vectara.com)
3. **Create a corpus** with `client.corpora.create()` (see [Corpus Management](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/api-reference/indexing-apis/corpus))
4. **Prepare files** on disk or as file objects (PDFs, DOCX, etc.)

## Initialize the Vectara Client

<CodePanel
  title="Initialize Vectara Client"
  snippets={[
    {
      language: 'python',
      code: `from vectara import Vectara
from vectara.core.api_error import ApiError

# Initialize client with API key
client = Vectara(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")`
    }
  ]}
  annotations={{
    python: [
      { line: 5, text: 'Use an API key with indexing permissions for file uploads' }
    ]
  }}
  customWidth="50%"
/>

Set up authentication to securely access file upload capabilities. Ensure your 
API key has indexing (write) permissions for the target corpus.

## Upload a basic file

<CodePanel
  title="Upload an HR policy document"
  snippets={[
    {
      language: 'python',
      code: `filename = "Employee_Benefits_2025.pdf"
    with open(filename, "rb") as f:
        file_content = f.read()
    
    response = client.upload.file(
        corpus_key="hr-policies",
        file=file_content,
        filename=filename,
        metadata={
            "department": "hr",
            "policy_type": "benefits", 
            "year": "2025",
            "document_category": "employee_handbook"
        }
    )`
    }
  ]}
  annotations={{
    python: [
      { line: 2, text: 'Open file in binary mode for upload' },
      { line: 6, text: 'Upload to specified corpus' },
      { line: 9, text: 'Include descriptive metadata for filtering and search' },
    ]
  }}
  customWidth="50%"
/>

Upload a document (HR policy or compliance guide) to a corpus. Vectara 
automatically parses, chunks, and indexes the content for semantic search. No 
manual processing is required.

The `upload.file` method corresponds to the HTTP POST `/v2/upload_file` 
endpoint. For more details on request and response parameters, see the 
[Upload File REST API](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/rest-api/upload-file).

**Key Parameters:**
- `corpus_key`: Target corpus identifier where the file will be stored
- `file`: Binary content of the file (read with `"rb"` mode)
- `filename`: Name of the file being uploaded
- `metadata`: Optional key-value pairs for filtering and categorization

**Supported File Types:** PDF, DOCX, DOC, TXT, HTML, Markdown

:::tip Note
Each file uploaded can be up to 10 MB in size.
:::

To update or overwrite an existing file, you must first delete the document 
using `client.documents.delete()` and then re-upload it, as direct updates to 
content are not supported. The file name is used as the document ID. Attempting 
to upload a file with the same name but different content will result in a 409 
error.

**Error Handling:**
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid parameters or unsupported file type
- **403 Forbidden**: Insufficient permissions
- **404 Not Found**: Corpus not found
- **409 Conflict**: Document with same ID exists but different content
- **413 Payload Too Large**: File exceeds size limit

      { line: 14, text: 'Boolean metadata values for precise filtering' }
    ]
  }}
  customWidth="50%"
/>

Upload files directly from file objects, perfect for streaming scenarios where files 
come from cloud storage, APIs, or other dynamic sources without local file storage.

**Streaming Use Cases:**
- Files downloaded from cloud storage (S3, Google Cloud, etc.)
- Content received through APIs or webhooks
- Temporary files that don't need local persistence
- Batch processing from external systems

To update or overwrite an existing file, you must first delete the document 
using `client.documents.delete()` and then re-upload it, as direct updates 
to content are not supported. The file name is used as the document ID. 
Attempting to upload a file with the same name but different content will 
result in a 409 error.

**Error Handling:**
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid parameters or unsupported file type
- **403 Forbidden**: Insufficient permissions
- **404 Not Found**: Corpus not found
- **409 Conflict**: Document with same ID exists but different content
- **413 Payload Too Large**: File exceeds size limit

    ]
  }}
  customWidth="50%"
/>

Upload invoices with enhanced table extraction to capture line items, amounts, 
and financial details. The system automatically processes itemized data for 
precise financial queries and analysis.

**Invoice-Specific Features:**
- Extracts line items, quantities, and prices
- Captures customer and vendor information
- Processes payment terms and due dates
- Enables queries about specific invoice components
- Supports financial analytics and reporting

**Financial Document Benefits:**
- Query specific line items: "What services were billed in Q4?"
- Analyze spending patterns: "Show all invoices over $100k"
- Track payment terms: "Which invoices have NET_30 terms?"
- Vendor analysis: "Total billing from AcmeCorp in 2025"

To update or overwrite an existing file, you must first delete the document 
using `client.documents.delete()` and then re-upload it, as direct updates to 
content are not supported. The file name is used as the document ID. 
Attempting to upload a file with the same name but different content 
will result in a 409 error.

**Error Handling:**
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid parameters or unsupported file type
- **403 Forbidden**: Insufficient permissions
- **404 Not Found**: Corpus not found
- **409 Conflict**: Document with same ID exists but different content
- **413 Payload Too Large**: File exceeds size limit

## Best practices and error handling

**File Upload Best Practices:**

<CodePanel
  title="Production-ready upload patterns"
  snippets={[
    {
      language: 'python',
      code: `# Validate file exists and is readable
        with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
            content = f.read()
        
        # Ensure file is not empty
        if len(content) == 0:
            return {"success": False, "error": "File is empty"}
        
        # Prepare metadata with defaults
        upload_metadata = {
            "upload_timestamp": "2025-07-03T12:00:00Z",
            "file_size_bytes": len(content),
            "original_filename": file_path.split('/')[-1]
        }
        upload_metadata.update(metadata or {})
        
        # Upload with appropriate configuration
        response = client.upload.file(
            corpus_key=corpus_key,
            file=content,
            filename=file_path.split('/')[-1],
            metadata=upload_metadata,
            table_extraction_config={"extract_tables": True}
        )
        
        return {"success": True, "response": response}`
    }
  ]}
  customWidth="50%"
/>

**Production Guidelines:**
- Always validate file existence and readability before upload
- Include comprehensive metadata for better searchability
- Use appropriate chunking strategies based on content type
- Enable table extraction for documents with structured data
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Monitor upload success rates and file processing times

**Error Handling:**
- **File Issues**: Validate file existence, permissions, and size
- **API Errors**: Check corpus permissions and file format support
- **Network Issues**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Large Files**: Consider chunked uploads for very large documents

**Metadata Recommendations:**
- Include document type, department, and date information
- Add file size and upload timestamp for tracking
- Use consistent naming conventions across your organization
- Include business-specific fields for filtering and analytics

## Next steps

After understanding file uploads:

- **Query uploaded content**: Use [Queries](/docs/sdk/python/query) to search 
  uploaded documents.
- **Document management**: Use [Documents](/docs/sdk/python/documents) to manage 
  uploaded content.
- **Chat integration**: Build conversational interfaces with uploaded documents 
  using [Chats](/docs/sdk/python/chats).
