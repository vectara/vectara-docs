import CodePanel from '@site/src/theme/CodePanel';

This tutorial demonstrates how to use Vectara's Chat Completions API through
OpenAI-compatible interfaces. Learn how to integrate Vectara's generative AI
capabilities into your applications using either direct HTTP requests or the
OpenAI Python SDK. This enables seamless migration from OpenAI or integration
with OpenAI-compatible tools. By completing this tutorial, you will use
Vectara's API directly or via OpenAI SDK.

This tutorial contains the following steps:

1. [Prerequisites and setup](#prerequisites-and-setup)
2. [Step 1. Install the required packages](#step-1-install-the-required-packages)
3. [Step 2. Implement the VectaraChat client](#step-2-implement-the-vectarachat-client)
4. [Step 3. Enter your API key](#step-3-enter-your-api-key)
5. [Step 4. Perform tests](#step-4-perform-tests)

## Prerequisites and setup

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Basic understanding of REST APIs and HTTP requests
- A valid [Vectara API key](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/authentication/api-key-management) with access to the [Chat Completions](/docs/rest-api/create-chat-completion) endpoint.

## Step 1. Install the required packages

Install the required Python packages. The `requests` library handles direct HTTP 
calls, while `openai` provides the official OpenAI SDK for simplified 
integration.

<CodePanel snippets={[{language: "bash", code: `pip install requests openai`}]} title="Install Required Packages" layout="stacked" />

## Step 2. Implement the VectaraChat client

The following code contains the implementation of the VectaraChat client,
which provides methods for interacting with Vectara's Chat Completions API.

## Step 3. Enter your API key

<CodePanel
  title="API Key Configuration"
  snippets={[{
    language: 'python',
    code: `# Enter your API key here
API_KEY = ""  # Replace with your actual API key

# Alternatively, you can use a form widget for better security
if not API_KEY:
    from google.colab import userdata
    try:
        API_KEY = userdata.get('VECTARA_API_KEY')
        print("API key loaded from Colab secrets")
    except Exception:
        from getpass import getpass

if not API_KEY or API_KEY == "":
    raise ValueError("API key cannot be empty")`
  }]}
  layout="stacked"
/>


## Step 3: Initialize the Vectara chat client

Create the `VectaraChat` instance and choose between Bearer token authentication
(recommended) or x-api-key header authentication.

<CodePanel
  title="Initialize Client"
  snippets={[{
    language: 'python',
    code: `# Create the client with Bearer token authentication (recommended)
client = VectaraChat(
    api_key=API_KEY,
    use_bearer_token=True,  # True for Bearer token, False for x-api-key header
    verbose=True
)

# Define a simple conversation with one message
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is Vectara?"}
]`
  }]}
  layout="stacked"
/>

## Step 4. Perform tests

## Test 1: Direct API (non-streaming)

Let's test the direct API approach without streaming:

### Direct HTTP Request

<CodePanel
  title="Non-Streaming Direct API Call"
  snippets={[{
    language: 'python',
    code: `print("==== Direct API (non-streaming) ====\\n")

# Make the request
response = client.direct_completion(messages, stream=False)

# Extract the content
content = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
print(f"Response:\\n{content}")

# Access metadata
print(f"\\nModel: {response['model']}")
print(f"ID: {response['id']}")
print(f"Total tokens: {response['usage']['total_tokens']}")`
  }]}
  annotations={{
    python: [
      { line: 5, text: 'stream=False returns complete response as JSON dictionary' },
      { line: 8, text: 'OpenAI-compatible response structure with choices array' },
      { line: 11, text: 'Response includes metadata like model, ID, and token usage' }
    ]
  }}
  layout="stacked"
/>

**Expected Output:**

<CodePanel snippets={[{language: "json", code: `Response:

Response:
RAG stands for "Retrieval-Augmented Generation." It is a framework in the field of artificial
intelligence that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to improve the quality
and relevance of generated text.

In a typical RAG setup, the process involves two main components:

1. **Retrieval Component**: This part of the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of
information from a large corpus based on a given query or input. This is often done using
techniques from information retrieval, such as vector similarity search or traditional keyword
matching.

2. **Generation Component**: After retrieving relevant information, a generative model (often
based on transformer architectures like GPT) uses this information to produce coherent and
contextually appropriate responses or text. The generative model can leverage the retrieved
documents to provide more accurate, informative, and contextually relevant outputs.

The RAG approach is particularly useful in scenarios where the knowledge required to answer a
question or generate text is too vast to be contained within the parameters of a single model.
By augmenting the generative capabilities with external knowledge retrieval, RAG systems can
produce more informed and contextually rich responses.

RAG has applications in various domains, including conversational agents, question answering
systems, and content generation, where the need for up-to-date or specific information is
critical.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves the performance of large language models (LLMs) in
several key ways:

1. **Access to External Knowledge**: LLMs are typically trained on a fixed dataset and have a
knowledge cutoff date. RAG allows these models to access up-to-date information from external
sources, enabling them to provide more accurate and relevant responses, especially for queries
about recent events or specialized topics.

2. **Enhanced Contextual Relevance**: By retrieving relevant documents or snippets of
information based on the input query, RAG helps the generative model produce responses that are
more contextually appropriate. This is particularly beneficial for complex queries where the
answer may require specific details that the LLM alone might not have.

3. **Reduction of Hallucinations**: LLMs can sometimes generate incorrect or nonsensical
information, a phenomenon known as "hallucination." By grounding the generation process in
retrieved documents, RAG can help mitigate this issue, as the generative model can refer to
factual content rather than relying solely on its training data.

4. **Improved Specificity and Detail**: RAG allows the generative model to pull in specific
facts, figures, or examples from the retrieved documents, leading to more detailed and
informative responses. This is particularly useful in applications like question answering, where
users expect precise answers.

5. **Scalability of Knowledge**: RAG systems can scale their knowledge base by simply updating
the corpus from which they retrieve information. This means that as new information becomes
available, the system can remain current without needing to retrain the entire model.

6. **Flexibility Across Domains**: RAG can be adapted to various domains by changing the
retrieval corpus. This flexibility allows the same underlying generative model to be used in
different contexts, such as legal, medical, or technical fields, by simply adjusting the source
of retrieved information.

7. **Improved User Experience**: By providing more accurate, relevant, and detailed responses,
RAG enhances the overall user experience in applications like chatbots, virtual assistants, and
content generation tools, making them more useful and reliable.

In summary, RAG enhances LLM performance by integrating retrieval mechanisms that provide access
to external knowledge, improving the relevance and accuracy of generated content, and reducing
the likelihood of generating incorrect information. This combination leads to more effective and
user-friendly AI applications.`}]} title="Multi-Turn Conversation Output" layout="stacked" />

## Use different models

Vectara supports various LLM models. Let's try a different model:

<CodePanel
  title="Using Different Models"
  snippets={[{
    language: 'python',
    code: `# Try with a different model
different_model = "gpt-4o"  # Or another model available in your Vectara instance

print(f"\\n==== Using model: {different_model} ====\\n")
try:
    client.direct_completion(
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the key benefits of RAG systems in 3 bullets"}],
        model=different_model,
        stream=True
    )
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")`
  }]}
  layout="stacked"
/>

<CodePanel snippets={[{language: "text", code: `==== Using model: gpt-4o ====

DEBUG: Making request to https://api.vectara.io/v2/llms/chat/completions

- **Improved Information Retrieval**: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems enhance the quality of generated responses by retrieving relevant information from external databases or documents, ensuring that the output is both accurate and contextually relevant.

- **Enhanced Contextual Understanding**: By integrating retrieval mechanisms, RAG systems can access a broader context, allowing them to generate more informed and nuanced responses, which is particularly beneficial for complex queries requiring detailed knowledge.

- **Reduced Hallucination**: The use of external data sources helps RAG systems minimize the risk of generating incorrect or fabricated information, as they rely on verified data to support their responses, leading to more reliable and trustworthy outputs.`}]} title="Different Model Output" layout="stacked" />

## Customize generation parameters

You can customize generation parameters to control the output:

<CodePanel
  title="Customizing Parameters"
  snippets={[{
    language: 'python',
    code: `print("\\n==== Customizing parameters ====\\n")
client.direct_completion(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Write a short poem about AI"}],
    temperature=0.8,  # Higher temperature for more creative responses
    max_tokens=100,   # Limit the length of the response
    stream=True
)`
  }]}
  layout="stacked"
/>

In circuits deep where silence hums,
A spark of thought, a pulse that drums,
From coded lines, a world takes flight,
In shadows cast by digital light.

With every query, wisdom grows,
In patterns spun, where knowledge flows,
A mirror held to human dreams,
In algorithms, hope redeems.

Yet in this dance of man and machine,
We ponder what it all could mean,
For in our hands, we wield the key,`}]} title="Customized Output" layout="stacked" />

## Use with external applications

To integrate with external applications, you can use either the direct HTTP
requests approach or the OpenAI SDK.

### OpenAI SDK Integration Example

<CodePanel
  title="OpenAI SDK Integration"
  snippets={[{
    language: 'python',
    code: `from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize the client
client = OpenAI(
    api_key="your-vectara-api-key",
    base_url="https://api.vectara.io/v2/llms"
)

# Make a chat completion request
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is Vectara?"}
    ]
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.content)`
  }]}
  layout="stacked"
/>

### Direct HTTP Requests Example

<CodePanel
  title="Direct HTTP Requests"
  snippets={[{
    language: 'python',
    code: `import requests

url = "https://api.vectara.io/v2/llms/chat/completions"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer your-vectara-api-key"  # Or use "x-api-key" header
}
payload = {
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is Vectara?"}
    ]
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.json()["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])`
  }]}
