Welcome to the documentation homepage for <Config v="names.product"/>, an end-to-end platform for 
product builders to embed powerful generative AI capabilities into 
applications with extraordinary results. <Config v="names.product"/> offers significant 
improvements over traditional searches by understanding the context and 
meaning of your data. This revolutionary technology enables <Config v="names.product"/> to 
drive insights and provide more accurate responses to user queries, 
assisting decision-making processes. User data remains secure because <Config v="names.product"/> 
never trains on customer data.

## The Future of Search is Here

The <Config v="names.product"/> team envisions a future where generative AI powers every 
application to deliver contextually accurate responses and give the right 
answers and actions. <Config v="names.product"/> is built on a solid **hybrid search** core 
to enable better generative outcomes. Traditional search technologies focus 
on keywords, which limit their ability to understand complex queries. <Config v="names.product"/> 
deploys advanced **zero-shot** models and **conversational search** 
capabilities to understand, interpret, and respond to user queries with remarkable 
precision. 

Vectara summarizes search results on complex queries while providing factual 
citations from your data. <Config v="names.product"/> provides the best hybrid search 
core and superior language understanding for ingestion and retrieval. <Config v="names.product"/> 
can become your answer engine.

## Developer-focused, API-first, Secure

Designed for developers with an API-first approach, <Config v="names.product"/> is 
the optimal choice to **integrate generative AI search** into your 
applications. This complete end-to-end platform provides easy ingestion and 
simple APIs. The <Config v="names.product"/> Generative AI platform enables 
developers with the flexibility to build a [wide range of applications](/docs/use-case-exploration) with
powerful search experiences.

The <Config v="names.product"/> platform never trains on customer data which enables 
businesses to embed generative AI capabilities without the risk of data or 
privacy violations. <Config v="names.product"/> provides support for customer-managed 
keys, encryption at rest and during transit, client-configurable data 
retention, and more.

## Solve the Hallucination Problem

AI content generators often create **hallucinations** – false information 
outside of the raw, factual data - they make stuff up. These hallucinations 
lead to inaccurate and misleading responses <Config v="names.product"/> addresses 
this problem through **Grounded Generation**, meaning it grounds the search 
results in the uploaded data. By focusing on facts and reducing 
hallucinations, <Config v="names.product"/> enhances trust in AI-powered decision making. 

## Language Agnostic

Use <Config v="names.product"/> to search across multiple languages, eliminating language 
barriers and enabling users to find what they need, regardless of the 
language they use. This **cross-language** approach provides a seamless 
search experience for users around the world. The best answer may be 
written in German but a user asked the question in Spanish.

The <Config v="names.product"/> platform is more than just an AI product. It is 
a pioneer in the realm of **neural search**, leading the way to harness the 
power of your data. <Config v="names.product"/> wants to transform the way 
developers interact with data and unlock a world of insights at their 
fingertips. Welcome to the future of information interaction!
