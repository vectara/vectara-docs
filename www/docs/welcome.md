Welcome to the documentation homepage for Vectara, an end-to-end platform for product builders 
to embed powerful generative AI capabilities into applications with extraordinary 
results. Vectara offers significant improvements over traditional searches by 
understanding the context and meaning of your data. This revolutionary technology
 allows Vectara to drive insights and provide more accurate responses to user 
 queries, assisting decision-making processes. Data remains secure because 
 Vectara never trains on your data.


## The Future of Search is Here

Vectara envisions a future where generative AI powers every application to 
deliver contextually accurate responses and give you the right answers and 
actions. Vectara is built on a solid **hybrid search** core to enable better 
generative outcomes. Traditional search technologies focus on keywords, 
which limit their ability to understand complex queries. Vectara deploys 
advanced **zero-shot** models and **conversational search** capabilities to understand, 
interpret, and respond to user queries with remarkable precision. 


Vectera summarizes search results on complex queries along with factual 
citations. Vectara provides the best hybrid search core and superior 
language understanding for ingestion and retrieval. Vectara can become 
your answer engine.


## Developer-focused, API-first, Secure

Vectara is designed for developers with an API-first approach, making it 
the optimal choice to **integrate generative AI search** into their applications. 
This full end-to-end platform provides easy ingestion and simple APIs.

The Vectara Generative AI platform enables developers with the flexibility 
to build a wide range of applications with powerful search experiences. 
Vectara never trains on your data which enables businesses to embed 
generative AI capabilities without the risk of data or privacy violations. 
Vectara provides support for customer-managed keys, encryption at rest and 
during transit, client-configurable data retention, and more.

## Solve the Hallucination Problem

AI content generators often create **hallucinations** â€“ false information outside 
of the raw, factual data, leading to inaccurate and misleading responses. Vectara 
addresses this problem through **Grounded Generation**, meaning it grounds the 
search results in the uploaded data. By focusing on facts and reducing 
hallucinations, Vectara enhances trust in AI-powered decision making. 


## Language Agnostic

Vectara supports search across multiple languages, eliminating language barriers 
and enabling users to find what they need, regardless of the language they use. 
This **cross-language** approach provides a seamless search experience for 
users around the world. The best answer may be written in German but a 
user asked the question in Spanish.

Vectara is more than just an AI product. It is a pioneer in the realm of 
**neural search**, leading the way to harness the power of your data. Vectara 
wants to transform the way developers interact with data and unlock a 
world of insights at their fingertips. Welcome to the future of 
information interaction.
