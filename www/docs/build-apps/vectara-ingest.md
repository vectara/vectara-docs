Vectara Ingest crawls datasets from pre-built crawlers (websites, RSS feeds, 
Jira, Notion, Docusaurus, SharePoint) and ingests them into Vectara. This sample ingestion 
framework includes preconfigured templates for pulling data from many popular 
data sources, including enterprise platforms like SharePoint, ServiceNow, and HubSpot.
