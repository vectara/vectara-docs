Vectara Ingest crawls datasets from pre-built crawlers (websites, RSS feeds, 
Jira, Notion, Docusaurus) and ingests them into Vectara. This sample ingestion 
framework includes preconfigured templates for pulling data from many popular 
data sources.

Go to the [code repository](https://github.com/vectara/vectara-ingest) for information about 
how to use Vectara Ingest.
