The Reach-Search component pulls data from your Vectara account and adds 
semantic search to your React apps with a few lines of code. [Interact with the 
demo](https://vectara.github.io/react-search/) to see how it works.

[Go to the code repository](https://github.com/vectara/react-search) for information about 
how to use React-Search.
