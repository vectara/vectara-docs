Vectara Answer provides a configurable sample UI that you can use as a 
starting point. This UI enables users to create custom conversational search 
applications, such as chatbots, semantic search, and workplace search by 
connecting to your [ingested data](/docs/build-apps/vectara-ingest). This project provides example code for a 
modern user-interface for Vectara GenAI conversational search. 

Go to the [code repository](https://github.com/vectara/vectara-answer) for information about 
how to use Vectara Answer.
