New users often find it challenging to get started with a new product and 
fully understand its capabilities. With <Config v="names.product"/>, we've made it simple with our 
Quick Start tutorial. In just a couple minutes, you'll be issuing queries and 
getting answers about your data.

## Step 1. Create a Vectara account

To get started with <Config v="names.product"/>, go to https://console.vectara.com/signup or
click **Get Started Free** at vectara.com. After you make an account, sign in!

You are greeted with this page which lets you try out a sample corpus with 
pre-filled data, or you can create your own corpus and upload data.

## Step 2. Try a sample corpus

Let's use the sample corpus that contains pre-filled data to learn about black 
holes! 

1. Select **Try out a sample corpus**.
2. Vectara creates a sample corpus named `black-holes-sample-data` and adds 
   data to this corpus.
3. The sample corpus appears with queries that you can select and information 
   about the corpus configuration, allowing you to select the **Preview type** 
   and how to open the **Inspector panel**.

4. Select the query *What's insides a black hole?* and view the results:

5. Open the **Inspector panel** and select **Request** view the API request, 
6. specifically the `query` and `search` details.:

7. Select the **Response** tab and view the `search_results` array:

 This information is helpful for debugging purposes.

So what's next? Keep asking questions, or upload your own data into a corpus. 


:::tip
If you want to start using our [**API Recipes**](/docs/api-recipes), you need
the `customer_id` and `corpus_key` values. <Config v="names.product"/> sent
you a welcome email with the Customer ID after you created the account. You 
set the Corpus Key when creating a corpus, but you can also view it in the UI.
:::

### View your Customer ID

After you create an account, you can click your name in the upper-right corner 
to view your Customer ID, email, account size, and more. You need the
Customer ID for many API requests.

You can click your name in the top, upper-right corner to reveal
the `customer_id`.

### View the Corpus Key

Next to the Corpora label in the upper left corner, click 
**black-holes-sample-data** to reveal the `corpus_key`, `corpus_id`, and other 
information about the corpus.
