Tables in PDFs are hard to query, because their structure is unpredictable and 
often complex. This can prevent researchers and analysts from extracting 
specific data points. Our tabular data extraction capability enables users to 
query and extract valuable information from structured tabular data embedded 
in PDFs, enhancing the overall data retrieval and analysis process.

This tabular data extraction is particularly valuable for financial 
organizations dealing with 10-Q, 10-K, and S1 reports:

* Streamline report analysis across various fields
* Improve accuracy in data extraction from PDF tables
* Enable more efficient querying of specific data in cells 


## Extraction capabilities

* Extract tabular data from PDF documents
* Query specific cell values within tables
* Semantic comparison between cell contents

## Limitations

* Complex tables with merged cells
* Cannot perform mathematical comparisons or computations across multiple cell values

## Supported table formats

* Clear, single-row headers
* Consistent data types within columns
* Simple row-column structure without merged cells
* Standardized formats for dates, currencies, and numerical data


## Extract tabular data

API and UI Procedures TBD
