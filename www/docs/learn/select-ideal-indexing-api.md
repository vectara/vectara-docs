Efficient data ingestion is critical for ensuring that your application 
delivers fast, accurate, and relevant query results. Whether handling 
structured, semi-structured, or unstructured data, selecting the 
right indexing method can significantly impact the performance and usability 
of your applications. Vectara offers multiple indexing methods to accommodate 
different use cases that enable users to efficiently index their data and 
leverage our advanced search capabilities. This flexible approach allows for 
the precise integration of Vectara’s search functionalities into different 
applications.

## Vectara Ingest: sample data ingestion framework

Getting data into Vectara is simple using either our REST or gRPC APIs. We 
built a full sample ingestion framework ready to go with [Vectara Ingest](https://github.com/vectara/vectara-ingest), which 
includes preconfigured templates that enable you to pull data from many 
popular data sources such as websites and RSS feeds.

## Data ingestion with the indexing APIs

Selecting the ideal Indexing API for your application can significantly impact 
the effectiveness of integrating Vectara’s search functionalities into your 
application. The best indexing method depends on your needs, such as when you 
have semi-structured or unstructured documents, or if you want more granular 
control over the data segmentation and indexing process.

Vectara offers the following indexing APIs for these different scenarios:

## File upload API

If you want to extract text from existing, unstructured documents in common 
file types with minimal manual intervention, use the [File Upload API](/docs/api-reference/indexing-apis/file-upload/file-upload). This 
option enables you to attach additional, user-defined metadata at the 
document level. 
  
You can also upload JSON versions of the same Document protocol buffers 
passed to the standard indexing API and the low-level indexing API, as long 
as the file ends with the `.json` extension. Our platform intelligently 
determines which flavor of document proto it's looking at. Note that sending 
any other kind of JSON to the indexing endpoint will cause it to error out.
  
We recommend this option if you have not written your own extraction logic 
already.

## Index document API
  
The Index Document API has a discriminator property `type` that determines the 
format of the document. The supported document types are `structured` and `core`.

### Structured document definition

If you have structured documents that you want Vectara to index and segment
into chunks for you, use the the `structured` type, which has a document with 
layout features such as `title`, `description`,` metadata`, `custom_dimensions`, and 
an array of `sections`. In Vectara, a `document` is very flexible in what it can 
represent. It can be as short as a tweet or as long as the 1600 page Bible.

The document is also broken down into sections. Each `sections` can 
have a unique `id`, `title`, `text`, and `metadata` and also contain other 
nested `sections`.
  
We recommend this option for applications where documents already have a 
clear and consistent structure like news articles, product descriptions, 
rows in database tables or CSV files, or records from an ERP system.


### Core document definition

For the most advanced use cases, if you want full, granular control to chunk 
your document into `document_parts`, use the `core` type, which has a document 
structure that closely corresponds to Vectara's internal document data model. 
It contains an `id`, `metadata`, and an array of individual `document_parts`, 
which make up granular sections of the overall document container. 
These parts define the actual text to be indexed. Each part is converted 
into exactly one vector in the underlying index. Each part can contain 
individual `text` blocks, `context`, and` metadata`, as well as custom dimension 
values that affect ranking results.
  
We recommend this option for Machine Learning teams with expertise in neural
information retrieval who want low-level control over how documents are 
indexed in our systems. Using the low-level API typically involves 
significant coordination between your Machine Learning team and 
organizational stakeholders.

By leveraging the appropriate data indexing method is based on the nature of 
your documents, you can ingest and structure your data for optimal performance 
with Vectara's Retrieval Augmented Generatation as-a-Service platform.
