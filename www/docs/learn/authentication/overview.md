Vectara has robust authentication and authorization methods in place to secure 
your data and operations, whether you are a Platform Admin configuring the 
system or tenant, a Development lead building applications for your enterprise, 
or an Application End User issuing queries through an app. We provide a 
structured authentication and authorization model to control access to our 
platform and your data. 

This overview introduces the supported mechanisms and access control levels, 
helps you understand what is platform-enforced versus application-enforced, 
and provides a quick reference to help answer key questions for 
internal discussions--useful for Dev Team Leads planning integrations or 
Business Leaders evaluating security.

## Authentication methods in Vectara

Vectara supports two authentication strategies:

- **API Keys** ‚Äì Lightweight tokens for direct API access, often used for quick 
  prototyping or front-end queries.
- **OAuth 2.0 Tokens** ‚Äì Expiring JWT tokens generated by app clients, suited for 
  secure production environments.

Use the following table to understand the key types, whether you develop 
applications and test APIs, or a Platform Admin configuring systems or managing 
corpora.


| API Key Type       | Key Prefix | Allowed Operations                                                 | Access Scope                            | Intended Use                                              |
|--------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Personal API Key**  | `zut_...`  | Some limitations such as not deleting your account or creating users | Account-wide (inherits user‚Äôs permissions) | Administrative tasks, prototyping, full access across corpora |
| **Query API Key**      | `zqt_...`  | Read-only search operations                                        | Corpus-specific                          | Front-end applications, public-facing query requests       |
| **Index API Key**      | `zwt_...`  | Read and write (indexing and querying)                             | Corpus-specific                          | Server-side indexing and querying                          |
| **OAuth 2.0 Token**    | (JWT token)| Scoped by roles granted to OAuth client                           | Account or corpus scope                  | Secure production authentication, third-party integrations |

## Authorization levels in Vectara

Vectara primarily enforces authorization at the **account** and **corpus** level 
through [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](/docs/learn/authentication/role-based-access-control), critical for 
Platform Admins managing users or Developers scoping corpus access. You can 
layer Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) by applying metadata-based filters
at query time.


| Authorization level               | What it controls                                                    | Supported roles and mechanisms                                            | How it works                                                                                  | Limitations                                                                                      |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Account-level** (application-level) | High-level admin and management actions across corpora              | Vectara Account Roles (Owner, Admin, Billing, etc.)                        | Grants full admin access across corpora and user management                                    | None. Fully supported. No access to specific document contents.                                 |
| **Corpus-level** (primary authorization layer) | Which users, API keys, or apps can query, index, or administer a corpus | Corpus Roles: Query (QRY), Index (IDX), Admin (ADM)                        | API keys and OAuth tokens are assigned access per corpus. No cross-corpus access unless explicitly granted. | Fully supported. Primary method for data segmentation.                                           |
| **Document-level** (per-user data isolation within corpus) | Ensures users only see their documents within a shared corpus      | No direct document-level roles                                             | Use metadata filters at query time (e.g., `metadata_filter: "user_id = X"`)                   | Workaround required. Not an enforced security model. Users with Query access could bypass filters if misused. |
| **Field-level** (granular document access) | Control over specific fields in a document                         | No built-in field-level roles                                              | Entire document contents are visible to anyone with Query (QRY) access to the corpus.         | Not supported natively. Workaround: store sensitive fields in a separate restricted corpus, or use metadata filters during queries. |
| **Multi-tenant** (per-customer access control) | Enforcing isolation for different customers                         | Segmentation per corpus (recommended)                                     | Assign each customer their own corpus, and grant API keys per corpus. Corpus isolation = platform-enforced; filters = app-enforced                        | Requires corpus management. Alternative (filters) offers weaker security.                        |
