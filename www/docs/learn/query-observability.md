As developers build generative AI applications, one of the biggest challenges 
is understanding why some queries fail to produce the expected results. 
Diagnosing these issues can be complex, and without clear insights into query 
execution, users are left guessing about the root cause of problems. This 
makes it difficult to debug and improve query performance.

Vectara’s query observability provides users with detailed insights into the 
execution of past queries by offering a comprehensive breakdown of each 
query’s configuration, response, and execution flow. This allows users to 
inspect queries at each stage of the query lifecycle which helps diagnose, 
debug, and optimize their searches.

## Query histories

The Query histories tab presents a table of previous queries executed against a 
selected corpus. A query history explains the actions taken by our platform in 
service of the query. 

Use this table to inspect query details, mark queries for special 
consideration, and annotate them with comments. The table lists each query ID, 
the time of the query, the mode (such as Summary), the query text, query 
response, latency, and any errors.

You can inspect each query by selecting an ID to see how the platform 
interpreted the query configuration and input, and how the system acted on 
this input, along with the responses and errors. 

## Query details

The query details page provides detailed visibility into how a our platform 
processed the query, offering valuable insights for both troubleshooting and 
optimization. These details include the query text, search results, generated 
response, and factual consistency score. 

For example:

![Query analysis](/img/query_analysis.png)

This example query detail shows the following configuration for the query:

* The application type is `Summary`.
* The hybrid search parameters set the lambda value to` 0.025`.
* Reranking is enabled and using `Rerank_Multilingual_v1`.
* The relevance tuning does not show any custom dimensions.
* The result context is 2 sentences before and after.
* This query used the `Mockingbird 1.0` prompt template with an English 
  summary language and 5 summarized results.
* The user enabled FCS with both 2 sentences before and after.
