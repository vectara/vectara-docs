At <Config v="names.company"/>, we treat your data with the utmost privacy:
* We do not use your data or searches to train our models.
* We isolate all customer instances from each other.
* We build <Config v="names.product"/> to protect and encrypt each corpus with 
  distinct symmetric keys. If any individual corpus is compromised, the rest 
  remain safe.
* We encrypt your data in-flight using [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](/docs/learn/authentication/auth-overview#transport-layer-security-tls).
* We encrypt your data on disk. [Users](https://vectara.com/pricing/) can even 
  [create and manage their own encryption keys](encryption).
