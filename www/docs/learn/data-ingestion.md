Vectara offers multiple data ingestion methods to accommodate different types
of use cases. By choosing the appropriate ingestion method, users can
efficiently index their data and leverage our advanced search capabilities.

## Vectara Ingest: Sample Data Ingestion Framework

Getting data into Vectara is simple using either our REST or gRPC APIs. We
built a full sample ingestion framework ready to go with [Vectara Ingest](https://github.com/vectara/vectara-ingest), which
includes preconfigured templates that enable you to pull data from many
popular data sources such as websites and RSS feeds.

## Standard Indexing API

We recommend the [Standard Indexing](/docs/api-reference/indexing-apis/indexing) method for
indexing a set of semi-structured documents or content into a corpus. Vectara
will index and chunk the documents for you.

You can also experiment with this REST endpoint in our interactive [API Reference](/docs/rest-api/index).

## File Upload API

The [File Upload](/docs/api-reference/indexing-apis/file-upload/file-upload) method exposes an
HTTP endpoint to upload and index files into a corpus. We recommend this
option when you do not need to define additional user-supplied metadata beyond
what is extracted by the Vectara platform. When you upload files like PDFs and
Word Documents, Vectara attempts to automatically extract the text and any metadata.

If you want to attach metadata for optimizing searches made against your data,
you can [format your data as JSON](/docs/api-reference/indexing-apis/file-upload/format-for-upload).

Our [interactive API Reference](/docs/rest-api/upload-file) enables you
to experiment with this File Upload REST endpoint.
