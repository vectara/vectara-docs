  <Config v="names.product" /> is an end-to-end Retrieval Augmented Generation
  as-a-Service (RAGaaS) platform for product builders to embed powerful
  generative AI capabilities into applications with extraordinary results.{" "}
  <Config v="names.product" /> offers significant improvements over traditional
  searches by understanding the context and meaning of your data. This
  revolutionary technology enables <Config v="names.product" /> to drive
  insights and provide more accurate responses to user queries, assisting
  decision-making processes. User data remains secure because{" "}
  <Config v="names.product" /> never trains on customer data.
</p>

## Welcome to the Answer Engine

The <Config v="names.product"/> team envisions a future where generative AI powers every
application to deliver contextually accurate responses and give the right
answers and actions. <Config v="names.product"/> is built on a solid **hybrid search** core
to enable better generative outcomes. Traditional search technologies focus
on keywords, which limit their ability to understand complex queries. <Config v="names.product"/>
deploys advanced **zero-shot** models and **conversational search**
capabilities to understand, interpret, and respond to user queries with remarkable
precision.

Vectara summarizes search results on complex queries while providing factual
citations from your data. <Config v="names.product"/> provides the best hybrid search
core and superior language understanding for ingestion and retrieval. <Config v="names.product"/>
can become your answer engine.

## Developer-focused, API-first, Secure

Designed for developers with an API-first approach, <Config v="names.product"/> is
the optimal choice to **integrate generative AI search** into your
applications. This complete end-to-end platform provides easy ingestion and
simple APIs. The <Config v="names.product"/> Generative AI platform enables
developers with the flexibility to build a [wide range of applications](/docs/use-case-exploration) with
powerful search experiences.

The <Config v="names.product"/> platform never trains on customer data which enables
businesses to embed generative AI capabilities without the risk of data or
privacy violations. <Config v="names.product"/> provides support for customer-managed
keys, encryption at rest and during transit, client-configurable data
retention, and more.

### :star2: Ready to Dive In? Check Out Our API Reference! :star2:

If you're ready to dive into our APIs, make your way to our [**API Reference V2.0**](/docs/rest-api/vectara-rest-api-v-2)!
This interactive environment allows you to experiment with <Config v="names.product"/>'s REST APIs
directly from your browser! Tailored for developers, the API Reference
offers a hands-on experience to understand and demonstrate our capabilities.

## Solve the Hallucination Problem

AI content generators often create **hallucinations** â€“ false information
outside of the raw, factual data - they make stuff up. These hallucinations
lead to inaccurate and misleading responses <Config v="names.product"/> addresses
this problem through **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**, meaning it grounds the search
results in the uploaded data. By focusing on facts and reducing
hallucinations, <Config v="names.product"/> enhances trust in AI-powered decision making.

## Language Agnostic

Use <Config v="names.product"/> to search across multiple languages, eliminating language
barriers and enabling users to find what they need, regardless of the
language they use. This **cross-language** approach provides a seamless
search experience for users around the world. The best answer may be
written in German but a user asked the question in Spanish.

The <Config v="names.product"/> platform is more than just an AI product. It is
a pioneer in the realm of **neural search**, leading the way to harness the
power of your data. <Config v="names.product"/> wants to transform the way
developers interact with data and unlock a world of insights at their
fingertips. Welcome to the future of information interaction!
