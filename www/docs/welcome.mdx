Vectara is the trusted AI Agent and Assistant platform that enables
enterprises to quickly build GenAI applications grounded in their own data.
Our end-to-end Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) platform minimizes
hallucinations, supports 100+ languages, and delivers enterprise-grade
security for production-ready AI solutions.

Deploy in your preferred environment, while maintaining complete data control. 
User data remains secure because Vectara never trains on customer data.

## AI agents and assistants

Build intelligent conversational systems that go beyond simple
question-and-answer:

- **Conversational assistants**: Natural dialogue interfaces that understand
  context and maintain conversation state.
- **AI agents**: Autonomous systems that search, reason, and take actions
  through conversations.
- **Multi-turn interactions**: Experiences that remember previous exchanges and
  provide coherent responses.

### Solve the hallucination problem
Unlike generic AI models, Vectara grounds responses in your actual data:

- **Factual Consistency Scoring**: Provides confidence ratings for every
  AI-generated response.
- **Source citations**: Links every answer back to specific documents and
  passages.
- **Retrieval-first architecture**: Ensures AI only uses information from your
  indexed content.
- **Purpose-built models**: Designed specifically for accurate enterprise AI.

### Best-in-class search technology
Hybrid search combines semantic and keyword capabilities:

- **Semantic understanding**: Finds information by meaning, not just keywords.
- **100+ language support**: Searches across documents in different languages
  simultaneously.
- **Advanced filtering**: Narrows results by metadata, document type, recency,
  and custom attributes.

### Enterprise-ready security
Built for mission-critical applications with complete data control:

- **Zero training on customer data**: Your content remains private and secure.
- **SOC 2 Type II and HIPAA certified**: Meets enterprise-grade security and
  compliance standards.
- **Fine-grained access control**: Role-based permissions and audit logging.
- **Flexible deployment**: Choose SaaS for simplicity or
  [private deployment](/docs/deployments) for complete data control, including
  VPC and on-premises options.
- **Centralized governance**: Unified platform to manage AI agents with
  comprehensive observability.
