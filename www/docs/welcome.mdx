Vectara is the Agent Operating System for trusted enterprise AI: a unified 
Agentic RAG platform with built-in multi-modal retrieval, orchestration, and 
always-on governance. Deploy it on-prem (air-gapped), in your VPC, or as SaaS. 
Vectara agents deliver grounded answers and safe actions with source 
citations, step-level audit trails, fine-grained access controls, and 
real-time policy and factual-consistency enforcement, so teams ship faster 
with lower risk, and with trusted, production-grade AI agents at scale.

Deploy in your preferred environment, while maintaining complete data control. 
User data remains secure because Vectara never trains on customer data.

## AI agents and assistants

Build intelligent conversational systems that go beyond simple
question-and-answer:

- **Conversational assistants**: Natural dialogue interfaces that understand
  context and maintain conversation state.
- **AI agents**: Autonomous systems that search, reason, and take actions
  through conversations.
- **Multi-turn interactions**: Experiences that remember previous exchanges and
  provide coherent responses.

### Enterprise-ready security
Built for mission-critical applications with complete data control:

- **Zero training on customer data**: Your content remains private and secure.
- **SOC 2 Type II and HIPAA certified**: Meets enterprise-grade security and
  compliance standards.
- **Fine-grained access control**: Role-based permissions and audit logging.
- **Flexible deployment**: Choose SaaS for simplicity or
  [private deployment](/docs/deployments) for complete data control, including
  VPC and on-premises options.
- **Centralized governance**: Unified platform to manage AI agents with
  comprehensive observability.
