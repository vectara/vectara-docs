Vectara is the trusted AI Agent and Assistant platform that enables enterprises 
to quickly build GenAI applications grounded in their own data. Our end-to-end 
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) platform minimizes hallucinations, 
supports 100+ languages, and delivers enterprise-grade security for 
production-ready AI solutions. User data remains secure because{" "}

## **AI assistants and agents**

Build intelligent systems that go beyond simple Q&A:

- **AI Assistants**: Answer complex questions by forming research plans and 
executing multi-step queries across your data.
- **AI Agents**: Take autonomous actions on behalf of users - schedule 
meetings, send notifications, update systems
- **Agentic RAG**: Leverage our Python package for building trusted, 
hallucination-resistant autonomous agents

### **Hallucination-resistant AI**
Unlike generic AI models, Vectara's responses are grounded in your actual data:

- **Factual Consistency Scoring**: Confidence ratings for every AI-generated response
- **Source Citations**: Every answer links back to specific documents and passages
- **Retrieval-First Architecture**: AI can only use information that exists in your indexed content

### **Best-in-class search technology**
Our hybrid search combines the best of semantic and keyword search:

- **Semantic Understanding**: Find information by meaning, not just keywords
- **100+ Language Support**: Search across documents in different languages simultaneously  
- **Sub-100ms Response Times**: Ultra-fast retrieval for real-time applications
- **Advanced Filtering**: Narrow results by metadata, document type, recency, and custom attributes

### **Enterprise-Ready Security**
Built for mission-critical applications with complete data control:

- **Zero Training on Customer Data**: Your content remains private and secure
- **SOC 2 Type II Certified**: Enterprise-grade security and compliance
- **Flexible Deployment**: Cloud, hybrid, or on-premises options
- **Fine-Grained Access Control**: Role-based permissions and audit logging
