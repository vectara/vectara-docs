Vectara is the trusted AI Agent and Assistant platform that enables enterprises 
to quickly build GenAI applications grounded in their own data. Our end-to-end 
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) platform minimizes hallucinations, 
supports 100+ languages, and delivers enterprise-grade security for 
production-ready AI solutions. User data remains secure because{" "}
<Config v="names.product" /> never trains on customer data.

## **AI assistants and agents**

Build intelligent systems that go beyond simple Q&A:

- **AI assistants**: Answer complex questions by forming research plans and 
executing multi-step queries across your data.
- **AI agents**: Take autonomous actions on behalf of users - schedule 
meetings, send notifications, update systems
- **Agentic RAG**: Leverage our Python package for building trusted, 
hallucination-resistant autonomous agents

### **Solve the hallucination problem**
Unlike generic AI models, Vectara's responses are grounded in your actual data:

- **Factual Consistency Scoring**: Confidence ratings for every AI-generated response
- **Source citations**: Every answer links back to specific documents and passages
- **Retrieval-first architecture**: AI can only use information that exists in your indexed content

### **Best-in-class search technology**
Our hybrid search combines the best of semantic and keyword search:

- **Semantic understanding**: Find information by meaning, not just keywords
- **100+ language support**: Search across documents in different languages simultaneously  
- **Advanced filtering**: Narrow results by metadata, document type, recency, and custom attributes

### **Enterprise-ready security**
Built for mission-critical applications with complete data control:

- **Zero training on customer data**: Your content remains private and secure
- **SOC 2 Type II and HIPAA certified**: Enterprise-grade security and compliance
- **Flexible deployment**: SaaS or on-premises options
- **Fine-grained access control**: Role-based permissions and audit logging
