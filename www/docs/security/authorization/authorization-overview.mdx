Control access to your Vectara resources with role-based, attribute-based, and multi-tenant access control.

Vectara provides multiple authorization mechanisms to control who can access what data and perform which operations. From role-based permissions that define broad access patterns to attribute-based filters that enable fine-grained control, Vectara's authorization framework helps you build secure, scalable applications.

## Authorization approaches

Vectara supports several complementary authorization strategies:

  <TopicButton title="Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)" href="/docs/security/authorization/role-based-access-control">
    <Spacer size="l" />
    Assign permissions based on predefined roles like QueryService or IndexService.

    Provides coarse-grained access control at the account and corpus level.

  <TopicButton title="Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)" href="/docs/security/authorization/attribute-based-access-control">
    <Spacer size="l" />
    Use metadata filters to control access at the document level.
    <Spacer size="l" />
    Enables fine-grained authorization based on user attributes and document properties.
    <Spacer size="l" />
  </TopicButton>
  <TopicButton title="Multi-Tenant Corpus Isolation" href="/docs/security/authorization/multi-tenant-corpus-isolation">
    <Spacer size="l" />
    Dedicate separate corpora to different tenants for complete data isolation.
    <Spacer size="l" />
    Simplifies access control and provides clear security boundaries.

  </TopicButton>
  <TopicButton title="Combine Access Control with Application Filters" href="/docs/security/authorization/combine-access-control-with-app-filters">
    <Spacer size="l" />
    Layer multiple authorization mechanisms for comprehensive security.
    <Spacer size="l" />
    Demonstrates real-world patterns combining RBAC, ABAC, and application logic.

## Choosing the right approach

Different scenarios call for different authorization strategies:

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Best for defining broad access patterns like "developers can query" or "admins can manage corpora"
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Ideal for fine-grained control based on user attributes or document properties
- **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: Essential for SaaS applications where complete data separation is required
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combine multiple mechanisms for layered security and flexibility

## Next steps

1. Start with **[Enterprise Access Patterns](/docs/security/authorization/vectara-personas-and-access-patterns)** to understand typical user roles and needs
2. Review **[Role-Based Access Control](/docs/security/authorization/role-based-access-control)** for account-level permissions
3. Explore **[Attribute-Based Access Control](/docs/security/authorization/attribute-based-access-control)** for document-level filtering
4. Consider **[Multi-Tenant Corpus Isolation](/docs/security/authorization/multi-tenant-corpus-isolation)** for complete data separation
5. See **[Combine Access Control](/docs/security/authorization/combine-access-control-with-app-filters)** for real-world implementation patterns
