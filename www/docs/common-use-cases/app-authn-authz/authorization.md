Authorization refers to the access control policies that define what actions an
authenticated entity may perform. A **permission** defines a
granular action, such as running a query against a specific corpus, or resetting
its contents. Related permissions are grouped together into **roles**, and
authenticated entites may be assigned one or more roles. In this context, an
**authenticated entity** refers to a user or an app client able to attest its
identity by presenting a valid JWT token. Even entities that lack explicit roles
may still be able to perform operations on the platform through the use of
**default permissions**.

## Roles

This section explains these concepts in further detail:

### Account Level Roles

- **Owner** is initially granted to whoever created the account. It grants
  all the permissions of the admin roles, below, as well as the ability to
  delete the account.
- **Account Administrators** can perform all actions on a account, except
  managing billing activity. These actions include managing users, API keys,
  managing corpora etc.
- **Corpus Administrators** can perform all corpus related actions within the
  account. This includes authorizing user roles on an account, deleting a corpus,
  creating corpora, and transferring ownership of a corpus.
- **Billing Administrators** can view and edit account billing activity.

### Corpus Level Roles

Users can also be authorized to perform various actions per corpus. This can be
done in the Authorization tab on the Corpus page.

- The **Query** role (QRY) allows querying the corpus.
- The **Indexing** role (IDX) allows data to be added to the corpus.
- The **Administrator** role (ADM) allows query and indexing the corpus, but
  also resetting it, deleting it, adding and removing user access, and
  transferring its ownership.

A corpus may also specifying querying or indexing as **default roles**. A default
role is a role that is granted to any authenticated user in the account. For
example, if you want any authenticated user to be able to run queries on the
corpus, you would add the query role as default. 

## Account Features

Account features differ from roles in that they are enforced for the entire
account and are generally tied to account tier. These features include:

1. Custom dimensions. Whether custom dimensions may be defined for corpora.
2. Maximum corpora per query.
3. Score retrieval. Whether or not downstream systems have access to the raw
   answer score. Advanced applications can utilize this information for
   thresholding, and for incorporation into downstream machine-learning systems.
4. Encoder swapping. Whether the indexing and querying encoders be swapped to
   support semantic similarity matching in addition to question-answer matching.
5. Textless. Defines whether corpora be built without storing the indexed text.
   Although all textual content is encrypted with per-corpus keys, this option
   may appeal when an even higher level of security is desired. Enabling this
   can potentially reduce the quality of search.
6. User rate limit. Whether per-user rate limits can be defined.
7. Corpus rate limit. Whether per-corpus rate limits can be defined.
8. Corpus encryption key. Whether every corpus uses a separate encryption key
   for maximum security. Currently this feature is enabled for all accounts and
   cannot be disabled.
9. Customer managed encryption key. Whether the account may use a customer
   managed master encryption key. This is an advanced feature that gives the
   customer total control over their data. By revoking access to the master
   key, the account will become inaccessible within minutes to the entire
   platform.
10. Document metadata. Specifies whether document level metadata may be stored
   while indexing. This is currently enabled for all accounts.
11. Document part metadata. Specifies whether part level metadata may be stored
   while indexing. This is currently enabled for all accounts.
