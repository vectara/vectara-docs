To start building with Vectara, review the following sections:

- **[Data ingestion](/docs/build/data-ingestion)**: Upload documents, configure chunking strategies, structure 
  metadata, and prepare the knowledge base that powers your search and agents. Learn about 
file formats, ingesting table data, document structure, and metadata filtering.  

  Start here if you are setting up your first corpus or need to understand how 
data flows into Vectara.
- **[Search and retrieval](/docs/search-and-retrieval)**: Review search methods, configure queries, rerankers, 
  generation parameters, and advanced summarization options. This information 
  helps power both direct queries and agent responses.  

  Start here if you understand data ingestion and need to configure how queries work.  
- **[Agent operating system](/docs/agents/agent-concepts)**: Create agents with instructions, 
  tools, and sessions. Orchestrate data ingestion and search into governed, 
  conversational AI and document workflow automation.

  Start here if you understand data and search, and you are ready to build the 
Agent OS layer.
- **[Tutorials](/docs/tutorials)** - Guides for some common use cases.
- **[Integrations](/docs/integrations)** - Connect Vectara to existing tools and workflows.
