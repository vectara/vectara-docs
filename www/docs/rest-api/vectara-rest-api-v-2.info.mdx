REST APIs provide a traditional integration path for web-based applications.
    You can find all of our APIs at `https://api.vectara.io/v2/<api-endpoint>`
    The API endpoints are outlined in the various subsections of this API
    Reference section and are designed to be intuitive and follow a standard
    RESTful structure.

    - The current version is **v2**.
    - `api-endpoint` follows a hierarchical structure, using lowercase and hyphens.
      For example, `/corpora/:corpus_key/documents`.

    ## API authentication

    All <Config v="names.product"/> APIs are authenticated. Indexing and Search
    APIs can be authenticated via [API Keys](/docs/deploy-and-scale/authentication/api-key-management).
    The Personal API Key enables most Admin actions for creating and deleting
    corpora, but for deleting accounts and accessing billing data, you need to use
    [OAuth 2.0](/docs/deploy-and-scale/authentication/oauth-2).

    ## API Reference and OpenAPI specifications

    You can find up-to-date OpenAPI specifications at
    [https://docs.vectara.com/vectara-oas-v2.yaml](https://docs.vectara.com/vectara-oas-v2.yaml).
    These specifications provide a comprehensive overview of the available
    endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.

    You can use these with tools of your choosing like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)
    or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

    1. Download the OpenAPI YAML file.
    2. Import the file into Insomonia or Postman.
    3. Start making API calls directly from the tool.

    Want to try the REST APIs live in your browser? Head over to our
    [Interactive API Reference](/docs/rest-api) and make
    real-time API calls from your browser.

    ## Explore the API Reference

    The sections below provide an overview of our REST API capabilities
    organized by functional area. Each section explains the business value and
    use cases, then links to the detailed API specifications in our
    [Interactive API Reference](/docs/rest-api).

    The Interactive API Reference provides:

    - Detailed parameter documentation

    ### Agent operating system

    Build conversational AI assistants that can search your data,
    call external APIs, and execute multi-step workflows. Create chatbots, virtual
    assistants, and automation agents with custom instructions and tool integrations.

    - Create agents with custom instructions and personality
    - Configure tools for search, API calls, and custom functions
    - Manage conversation sessions with context persistence
    - Send and receive messages in agent conversations
    - Version and test instructions before deployment
    - Connect to Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool servers

    **API Reference:** [Agent APIs](/docs/rest-api#tag/Agents)

    ### Search and retrieval

    Find relevant information across your knowledge base using
    natural language queries, semantic search, and advanced filtering. Power
    search experiences in applications, chatbots, and knowledge management systems.

    - Search across multiple corpora simultaneously
    - Apply metadata filters to narrow results
    - Configure pagination and result limits
    - Enable summarization and answer generation
    - Use hybrid search (keyword + semantic)

    **API Reference:** [Query APIs](/docs/rest-api#tag/Queries)

    ### Corpora management

    Organize and structure your knowledge base by creating isolated
    data collections (corpora) with their own configurations, embeddings, and access controls.
    Think of corpora as databases or containers for related documents.

    - Create and configure corpora with custom settings
    - Manage filter attributes for metadata-based search
    - Monitor corpus size and usage
    - Enable or disable corpora
    - Reset corpus contents while preserving configuration

    **API Reference:** [Corpus APIs](/docs/rest-api#tag/Corpora)

    ### Document operations

    Populate your knowledge base with content from various sources.
    Index structured data, upload files for automatic parsing, and maintain document
    metadata for filtering and organization.

    - Index documents in structured or core format
    - Upload files (PDF, DOCX, HTML, etc.) for automatic extraction
    - Update document metadata for better filtering
    - Delete outdated or incorrect documents
    - Retrieve document contents and metadata
    - Extract and process tables from documents

    **API Reference:** [Document APIs](/docs/rest-api#tag/Documents)

    ### Authentication and security

    Secure your API access and control who can read, write, and
    manage your data. Implement API key authentication for applications and OAuth 2.0
    for user-based access with fine-grained permissions.

    - Generate and manage API keys with specific permissions
    - Create OAuth 2.0 application clients
    - Configure role-based access control
    - Audit API usage and access patterns
    - Enable or disable keys and clients
    - Reset credentials securely

    **API Reference:** [API Keys](/docs/rest-api#tag/API-Keys) and [Application Clients](/docs/rest-api#tag/Application-Clients)

    ### User management

    Control team access to your Vectara account. Add developers,
    data scientists, and administrators with appropriate permissions. Manage user
    lifecycle from onboarding to offboarding.

    - Create users with specific roles
    - Update user permissions and status
    - Remove users from your account
    - Initiate password resets
    - List all users and their roles

    **API Reference:** [User APIs](/docs/rest-api#tag/Users)

    ### Encoders, rerankers, and LLMs

    Customize your search and generation pipeline. Use different
    embedding models for domain-specific data, apply rerankers to improve result
    quality, and configure large language models for answer generation.

    - Create custom encoders for specialized domains
    - List available embedding models
    - Configure reranking models for result improvement
    - Add custom LLM configurations
    - Set generation presets for consistent prompt templates
    - Use OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint

    **API Reference:** [Encoders](/docs/rest-api#tag/Encoders), [Rerankers](/docs/rest-api#tag/Rerankers), and [LLMs](/docs/rest-api#tag/Large-Language-Models)

    ### Hallucination detection and correction

    Ensure factual accuracy in AI-generated responses. Detect when
    language models hallucinate information not supported by your source documents and
    correct inaccuracies before presenting answers to users.

    - Evaluate factual consistency using Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM)
    - Score responses against source documents
    - Access hallucination correction models
    - Improve response accuracy and reliability

    **API Reference:** [Hallucination APIs](/docs/rest-api#tag/Evaluation)

    ### Background jobs

    Monitor long-running operations like large file uploads,
    corpus resets, or bulk document operations. Track job status, progress, and
    completion to build reliable asynchronous workflows.


    - Retrieve job status and progress
    - List all jobs for your account
    - Filter jobs by status and type
    - Track job completion and errors

    **API Reference:** [Job APIs](/docs/rest-api#tag/Jobs)

    ### Query history

    Analyze search patterns, understand user behavior, and improve
    your search experience. Access detailed logs of queries, results, and user interactions
    for analytics and optimization.

    - Retrieve query history for a corpus
    - Access query metadata and results
    - Filter by date range and query type
    - Export for analytics and reporting

    **API Reference:** [Query History APIs](/docs/rest-api#tag/Query-History)

    ## Request timeouts

    By default, requests will take as long as they need to complete. However, you
    can request a maximum time for most of the APIs to take by specifying the
    `Request-Timeout` or `Request-Timeout-Millis` parameters in the HTTP headers.
    `Request-Timeout` is specified in seconds and if you need a more granular
    timeout, you can use `Request-Timeout-Millis`. Note that both parameters are
    considered best-effort: in the event either time lapses, Vectara will attempt
    to terminate the request as soon as possible after.
