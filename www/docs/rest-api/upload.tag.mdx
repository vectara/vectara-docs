Upload files to a corpus for automatic parsing, text extraction, chunking, and indexing.

      ## Supported file formats

      The upload endpoint supports several raw document types. Vectara extracts text
      from these documents and sections them as best it can. This provides a
      convenient way to index text, yet the caller has less control compared to when
      providing the `Document` proto message themselves. The following raw document
      types are officially supported:

      - Commonmark / Markdown (`md` extension).
      - PDF/A (`pdf`).
      - Open Office (`odt`).
      - Microsoft Word (`doc`, `docx`).
      - Microsoft Powerpoint (`ppt`, `pptx`).
      - Text files (`txt`).
      - HTML files (`.html`).
      - LXML files (`.lxml`).
      - RTF files (`.rtf`).
      - ePUB files (`.epub`).
      - Email files conforming to RFC 822.

      ### Semi-structured documents

      Use the [Create Corpus Document endpoint](/docs/rest-api/create-corpus-document) for semi-structured documents.

      ### Additional file type support

      While the Vectara platform directly supports the file types listed above 
      through the file upload API, customers who need support for additional file 
      types or data sources can use [Vectara Ingest](https://github.com/vectara/vectara-ingest), 
      an open-source Python framework.

      Vectara Ingest is an open-source Python framework that demonstrates how to 
      crawl datasets and ingest them into Vectara. It extends the file type support 
      beyond what is available in the standard file upload API.

      :::caution Important
      Vectara Ingest is an open-source project provided by Vectara without official 
      support. This tool is provided "as-is" without warranties and usage is at your
