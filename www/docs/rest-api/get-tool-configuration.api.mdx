This pattern sets the href for HTML or the text within `[]` in markdown, and defaults to N being the index of result if it is not set. The default citation style looks like `[N](<url_pattern>)` for markdown. You can use metadata attributes in the `text_pattern`. For example, the pattern `{doc.title}` with citation style `markdown` would result in final citation output like `[Title](<url_pattern>)` when the document's metadata includes `{\"title\":\"Title\"}`.","type":"string","example":"{doc.title}"}},"title":"CitationParameters"},"enable_factual_consistency_score":{"description":"Enable returning the factual consistency score with query results.","type":"boolean","default":true}},"title":"GenerationParameters"},"save_history":{"description":"Indicates whether to save the query to query history.","type":"boolean"}},"required":["search"],"title":"CorporaSearchQueryConfiguration"},"metadata":{"description":"Optional metadata associated with this tool configuration.","type":"object","additionalProperties":true,"example":{"tags":["production","v2"],"owner":"team-search"}},"created_at":{"description":"Timestamp when the tool configuration was created.","type":"string","format":"date-time"},"updated_at":{"description":"Timestamp when the tool configuration was last updated.","type":"string","format":"date-time"}},"required":["id","version","type","query_configuration"],"x-vectaraParents":["ToolConfiguration"],"title":"CorporaSearchToolConfiguration"},{"description":"A reusable configuration for a web search tool that stores predefined search parameters and settings.","type":"object","properties":{"id":{"description":"Unique identifier for a tool configuration.","type":"string","pattern":"^tcf_.*","example":"tcf_123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000","title":"ToolConfigurationId"},"name":{"description":"Human-readable name for the tool configuration.","type":"string","example":"Customer Support Search Config"},"description":{"description":"A detailed description of what this tool configuration is for and how it should be used.","type":"string","example":"Configuration for searching customer support documentation with optimized parameters"},"version":{"description":"The version identifier for this tool configuration.
