Perform an advanced query on a specific corpus to find relevant results, highlight relevant snippets, and use Retrieval Augmented Generation:

* Specify the unique `corpus_key` identifying the corpus to query. The `corpus_key` is [created in the Vectara Console UI](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/console-ui/creating-a-corpus) or the [Create Corpus API definition](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/api-reference/admin-apis/create-corpus). When creating a new corpus, you have the option to assign a custom `corpus_key` following your preferred naming convention. This key serves as a unique identifier for the corpus, allowing it to be referenced in search requests. For more information, see [Corpus Key Definition](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/api-reference/search-apis/search#corpus-key-definition).
* Customize your search by specifying the query text (`query`), pagination details (`offset` and `limit`), and metadata filters (`metadata_filter`) to tailor your search results. [Learn more](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/api-reference/search-apis/search#query-definition)
* Leverage advanced search capabilities like reranking (`reranker`) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) (`generation`) for enhanced query performance. Generation is opt in by setting the `generation` property. By excluding the property or by setting it to null, the response
will not include generation. [Learn more](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/grounded-generation/configure-query-summarization).
* Use hybrid search to achieve optimal results by setting different values for `lexical_interpolation` (e.g., `0.025`). [Learn more](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/hybrid-search)
* Specify Vectara's RAG-focused LLM (Mockingbird) for the `generation_preset_name`. [Learn more](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/mockingbird-llm)
* Use advanced summarization options that utilize detailed summarization parameters such as `max_response_characters`, `temperature`, and `frequency_penalty` for generating precise and relevant summaries. [Learn more](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/api-reference/search-apis/search#advanced-summarization-options)

For more detailed information, see [Query API guide](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/api-reference/search-apis/search).
