A Vectara private deployment is designed for organizations with specific 
infrastructure, security, or compliance requirements that necessitate private 
deployment. Contact our enterprise sales team to determine if a private 
deployment is the right choice for your organization. Why choose a private deployment?

* **Complete data sovereignty:** Your data never leaves your infrastructure. All 
  processing, storage, and computation occurs within your controlled 
  environment, ensuring compliance with the strictest data residency 
  requirements.
* **Enhanced security and compliance:** Meet regulatory requirements for 
  industries such as finance, healthcare, defense, and government. Private 
  deployment supports air-gapped deployments and integrates with your existing 
  security controls and compliance frameworks.
