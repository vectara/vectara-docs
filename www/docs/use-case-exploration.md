The AI era has changed interactions between people and information 
dramatically. Users expect relevant answers to questions in a natural 
language, and they expect the best results with the right context. 
Using <Config v="names.product"/> gives you relevant results no matter how you ask. Our 
conversational search platform generates summarized responses that speak your 
language. Better results enable better outcomes that reduce support costs and 
improve the customer experience.

## Why Vectara? Get Answers and Better Outcomes

The <Config v="names.product"/> platform has a unique ability to understand and process 
information. Our platform uses **hybrid search** to find the most relevant 
products, support cases, and documents that answer your user’s questions first. 
Power chatbots, Q&A systems, conversational applications and websites that base 
their information on what you and your users care about – information grounded 
in facts. <Config v="names.product"/> also provides result recommendations and enables global 
collaboration through its **cross-language** search. 

## Vectara GenAI Use Cases

This versatile <Config v="names.product"/> GenAI platform caters to a wide range of use 
cases to drive better outcomes and unlock new possibilities in search 
applications. <Config v="names.product"/> provides an easy entry point to generative AI 
capabilities while protecting company IP and customer data. The data 
is secure. <Config v="names.product"/> does not train on user data and respects data 
sovereignty and provides you with peace of mind.

### Choose the Data for Ingestion

You might be wondering what kind of data to select for ingestion. Our [Vectara Quick Start Tutorial](/docs/quickstart)
provides an example that gets you set up and searching for answers quickly!

Here are some other ideas to let you see <Config v="names.product"/> in action:

* Employee handbook
* Product manuals
* Legal contracts
* Research papers
* Training materials
* Financial reports
* Government regulations.

These types of documents contain very nuanced information where semantic search 
really shines! Think about what information takes a long time for a user to 
locate manually in a large volume. Unless you know exact keywords and section 
titles, you might struggle to find the exact information you need for understanding 
a real-estate contract, complex machine repair, conducting scientific 
research, and so on.

### Conversational AI

sits behind virtual assistants, chatbots, and messaging applications to 
help businesses automate customer service and streamline operations.
