The <Config v="names.product"/> **Retrieval Augmented Generation as-a-Service 
(RAGaaS)** platform enables organizations to rapidly create GenAI experiences 
to reduce hallucinations and provide relevant results no matter how you 
ask. Users expect relevant answers to questions in a natural language, and 
they expect the best results with the right context. Our conversational search 
platform generates summarized responses that speak your language. Better 
results enable better outcomes that reduce support costs and improve the 
customer experience.

The <Config v="names.product"/> platform has a unique ability to understand and process 
information. Our platform uses **semantic search** to find the most relevant 
products, support cases, and documents that answer your user’s questions first. 
Power chatbots, Q&A systems, conversational applications and websites that base 
their information on what you and your users care about – with RAG - information 
grounded in facts from the indexed data. Vectara also provides result 
recommendations and enables global collaboration through its 
**cross-language** search.

## Vectara GenAI Use Cases

This versatile <Config v="names.product"/> GenAI platform caters to a wide range of 
[Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](/docs/learn/grounded-generation/grounded-generation-overview) use cases to drive better outcomes and 
unlock new possibilities in [semantic search](/docs/learn/semantic-search/semantic-search-overview) 
applications. <Config v="names.product"/> provides an easy entry point to generative AI 
capabilities while protecting company IP and customer data. The data 
is secure. <Config v="names.product"/> does not train on user data and respects data 
sovereignty and provides you with peace of mind.

### Choose the Data for Ingestion

You might be wondering what kind of data to select for ingestion. Our [Vectara Quick Start Tutorial](/docs/quickstart)
provides an example that gets you set up and searching for answers quickly!

Here are some other ideas to let you see <Config v="names.product"/> in action:

* Employee handbook
* Product manuals
* Legal contracts
* Research papers
* Training materials
* Financial reports
* Government regulations.

These types of documents contain very nuanced information where semantic search 
really shines! Think about what information takes a long time for a user to 
locate manually in a large volume. Unless you know exact keywords and section 
titles, you might struggle to find the exact information you need for understanding 
a real-estate contract, complex machine repair, conducting scientific 
research, and so on.

calls. Making conversational AI easier to use increases both customer
