The Vectara platform enables you to build trusted AI experiences across
multiple use cases, from conversational AI agents to document generation and
research applications. Our solution combines
[Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](/docs/learn/grounded-generation/grounded-generation-overview)
and [semantic search](/docs/learn/semantic-search/semantic-search-overview)
with enterprise governance to deliver accurate, grounded responses.

Build applications that understand natural language queries without requiring
deep AI expertise. Vectara reduces hallucinations, supports 100+ languages,
maintains enterprise-grade security, and never trains on customer content.

### Conversational AI and virtual assistants

Build intelligent conversational experiences that understand context and provide accurate responses:

- **Customer service virtual assistants**: Deploy 24/7 self-service assistants, 
  support bots, or help desk agents.
- **Engineering and operations support**: Provide technical specifications, machine 
  configurations, and troubleshooting guides through natural conversation.
- **Department-specific agents**: Create specialized conversational AI from  
  company data and knowledge for sales, HR, legal, or IT teams.

Learn more in our [Conversational AI documentation](/docs/agents/conversational-ai).

### Document generation and analysis

Transform how your organization creates and analyzes documents:

- **Scalable RFP generation**: Automatically generate responses based on 
  enterprise domain data.
- **AI-driven loan underwriting**: Increase accuracy with built-in guardrails 
  and compliance checks.
- **Contract analysis**: Build AI agents that ensure compliance with pricing policies, 
  vendor lists, and regulatory standards.

### Research and knowledge discovery

Accelerate research and uncover insights from large document collections:

- **Scientific research**: Help R&D teams discover new materials and novel designs 
  faster by searching through publications and research papers.
- **Financial analysis**: Analyze financial reports, market data, and regulatory 
  filings to guide investment decisions.
- **Legal research**: Search through case law, statutes, and legal documents to 
  find relevant precedents and insights.

Vectara acts as a global research assistant that reads and understands large 
volumes of documents instantly, providing [recommendations](/docs/learn/recommendation-systems/recommender-overview) and citations grounded in your data.

### Question answering and knowledge management

Enable precise answers from your organization's knowledge base:

- **Internal knowledge systems**: Let employees quickly find information 
  from company handbooks, policies, and training materials.
- **Customer support**: Embed FAQs and support documentation to provide 
  instant, accurate responses.
- **Product information**: Help users find specifications, manuals, and 
  troubleshooting guides.

Create a dynamic [question and answer system](/docs/learn/question-answer/question-answer-overview) that continuously improves user experience.

### Semantic search for applications

Embed powerful search capabilities into your applications without becoming an 
LLM expert:

- **E-commerce product search**: Help customers find products using natural 
  language descriptions.
- **Document repositories**: Enable users to search across large document 
  collections by meaning, not just keywords.
- **Support ticket analysis**: Find similar cases and relevant solutions 
  from historical support data.

Vectara bridges the gap between user queries and your data, delivering 
relevant results regardless of how questions are phrased.

Our [Quick Start Tutorial](/docs/quickstart) shows you how to index and search 
your data quickly. Common data types that work well with Vectara include:

- Employee handbooks and training materials
- Product manuals and technical documentation
- Legal contracts and compliance documents
- Research papers and scientific publications
- Financial reports and regulatory filings
- Knowledge base articles and support content

These document types contain nuanced information where semantic search excelsâ€”helping users find specific details without knowing exact keywords or section titles.
