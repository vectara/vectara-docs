Secure your Vectara applications with enterprise-grade authentication, authorization, and data privacy controls. This section covers how to authenticate API access, control user permissions, and ensure compliance with security standards.

## Authentication

Secure your API access with API keys or OAuth 2.0:

- **[Authentication Overview](/docs/security/authentication/auth-overview)** - Learn about authentication options and when to use them
- **[Choose Authentication Method](/docs/security/authentication/choose-auth-method)** - Compare API keys vs OAuth 2.0 for your use case
- **[API Key Management](/docs/security/authentication/api-key-management)** - Create and manage API keys for development and testing
- **[OAuth 2.0](/docs/security/authentication/oauth-2)** - Set up OAuth 2.0 for production applications

## Authorization

Control access to your Vectara resources with fine-grained permissions:

- **[Role-Based Access Control](/docs/security/authorization/role-based-access-control)** - Assign permissions by role (RBAC)
- **[Attribute-Based Access Control](/docs/security/authorization/attribute-based-access-control)** - Fine-grained permissions using metadata filters (ABAC)
- **[Multi-Tenant Corpus Isolation](/docs/security/authorization/multi-tenant-corpus-isolation)** - Separate data by tenant or customer
