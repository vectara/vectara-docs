To start building with Vectara, review the following sections:

## 1. [Data Ingestion](build/data-ingestion)

Upload documents, configure chunking strategies, structure metadata, and 
prepare the knowledge base that powers your search and agents. Learn about 
file formats, ingesting table data, document structure, and metadata filtering.

Start here if you are setting up your first corpus or need to understand how 
data flows into Vectara.

## 2. [Search and Retrieval](/docs/search-and-retrieval)

Review search methods, configure queries, rerankers, generation parameters, and 
advanced summarization options. This information helps power both direct queries 
and agent responses.

Start here if you understand data ingestion and need to configure how queries work.

## 3. [Agent Operating System](/docs/build/agent-os/agent-platform-overview)

Create agents with instructions, tools, and sessions. Orchestrate data 
ingestion and search into governed, conversational AI and document workflow 
automation.

Start here if you understand data and search, and you are ready to build the 
Agent OS layer.

## Not Building Agents?

Vectara's data ingestion and search capabilities work independently. Many customers 
use Vectara without agents for RAG applications, document search, and Q&A systems.
