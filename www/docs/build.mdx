import CodePanel from '@site/src/theme/CodePanel';

To start building with Vectara, review the following sections:

## 1. [Data Ingestion](build/data-ingestion)
Set up your knowledge base. Upload documents, configure metadata
and chunking strategies.

## 2. [Search and Retrieval](/docs/search-and-retrieval)
Configure the RAG engine. Set up hybrid search, rerankers, and
generation parameters.

## 3. [Agent Operating System](/docs/build/agent-os/agent-platform-overview)
Build governed agents. Orchestrate data and search into
conversational AI and workflow automation.

**Already familiar with RAG and Agents?** Jump to [Agent OS](/docs/build/agent-os/agent-platform-overview) 
and our [API Reference](docs/rest-api) directly.

**Just need search?** You can use Vectara without agents.
