  title: Vectara REST API v2
  description: |
    Vectara provides an end-to-end platform for creating GenAI products using 
    a simple to use API.

    You can [sign up for an account](https://console.vectara.com/signup) and 
    then view several [API Recipes](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/api-recipes) with example queries 
    and parameter values.

    The Vectara API Playground lets you experiment with REST endpoints from 
    your browser. Select an endpoint to view its definition, including the 
    required or optional headers, body, responses, and sample commands. On the 
    right side of each endpoint page, like [Get Corpus](/docs/rest-api/get-corpus), you manually 
    enter your API Key or OAuth Bearer Token, `customer_id`, and then any 
    required body parameters like the `corpusID` before sending the API 
    request.

    :::note

    Vectara supports two primary methods of authentication: API keys and OAuth 
    2.0, which are applicable to all endpoints. Query API Keys are used for 
    read-only querying operations, while Index API Keys provide read and write 
    access. The OAuth 2.0 operations authenticate with a Bearer Token via the 
    OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant. Review the [**OAuth 2.0 section**](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/authentication/oauth-2) about 
    how to generate the token.

      summary: Query Corpora
      description: |
        Perform a multi-purpose query that can retrieve relevant information from one or more corpora and generate a response using RAG.

        Generation is opt in by setting the `generation` property. By excluding the property or by setting it to null, the response
        will not include generation.

            A prompt is an object with a bundle of properties that specifies:
              * The `prompt_text` that is rendered then sent to the LLM.
              * The LLM used.
              * `model_parameter`s such as temperature.
             
            All of these properties except the model can be overriden by setting them in this
            object. Even when a `prompt_text` is set, the `prompt_name` is used to set 
            the model used.

            If `prompt_name` is not set the Vectara platform will use the default model and
            prompt.

            prompt_text via this variable. The prompt_text is in the form of an
            Apache Velocity template. For more details on how to configure the
            prompt_text, see the long-form documentation at
            https://docs.vectara.com/docs/prompts/vectara-prompt-engine.

            This is a rough estimate and not a hard limit: the end output can be longer or shorter
            than this value. This is generally implemented by including the `max_response_characters` in the
            prompt, and the LLM's instruction following capability dictates how closely the generated output
            is limited.

            You can use metadata attributes in the `text_pattern`. For example,
            the pattern `{doc.title}` with citation style `markdown` would result
            in final citation output like `[Title](<url_pattern>)` when
