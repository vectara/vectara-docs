      summary: Create a corpus
      x-supported-api-key-type:
      - Personal
      description: "The Create Corpus API lets you create a corpus to store and manage\
        \ your documents. A corpus is a container for documents and their associated\
        \ metadata. When creating a corpus, you can specify various settings such\
        \ as the corpus key, name, description, encoder, and filter attributes.\n\n\
        ## Corpus object\n\nWhen you create a `corpus` object, the `corpus_key` property\
        \ is required to uniquely identify the corpus. The `name` parameter is optional\
        \ and defaults to the value of `key`. The optional `description` properties\
        \ lets you provide additional information about the corpus. When creating\
        \ a new corpus, you also have the flexibility to specify a custom `corpus_key`\
        \ that follows a naming convention of your choice. This allows you to assign\
        \ easily identifiable keys to your corpora, making it easier to manage and\
        \ reference them in your application.\n\nYou can specify whether to treat\
        \ queries or documents in the corpus as questions or answers using the `queries_are_answers`\
        \ and `documents_are_questions` boolean properties. These settings affect\
        \ the semantics of the encoder used at query time and indexing time.\n\n##\
        \ Add metadata as filter attributes\n\nWhen creating a corpus with this endpoint\
        \ or the Vectara Console, you define metadata fields using the `filter_attributes`\
        \ object. This ensures the corpus supports filtering on specific metadata\
        \ attributes, either at the document level or the part level.\n\nFilter attributes\
        \ enable you to attach metadata to your data at the document (`doc`) or `part`\
        \ level, which you can use later in filter expressions to narrow the scope\
        \ of your queries. A filter attribute must specify a unique `name` (up to\
        \ 64 characters long), and a `level` which indicates whether it exists in\
        \ the `doc` or `part` level metadata. At indexing time, metadata with this\
        \ name is extracted and made available for filter expressions to operate on.\
        \ [Learn more](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/build/prepare-data/metadata-filters)\n\
        \n### Doc and part filter levels\n\nThe `doc` attribute applies to the entire\
        \ document. Use this for metadata that is consistent across the whole document,\
        \ such as author, publication date, and document ID.\n\nThe `part` attribute\
        \ applies to specific sections or chunks within a document. Use for metadata\
        \ that may vary within different parts of the document, such as sections,\
        \ page numbers, and sentiment scores.\n\nIf `indexed` is true, the system\
        \ will build an index on the extracted values to further improve the performance\
        \ of filter expressions involving the attribute.\n\nFilter attributes must\
        \ specify a `type`, which is validated when documents are indexed. The four\
        \ supported types are `integer`, which stores signed whole-number values up\
        \ to eight bytes in length; `real`, for storing floating point values in [IEEE\
        \ 754 8-byte format]; `text` for storing textual strings in [UTF-8 encoding],\
        \ and `boolean` for storing true/false values.\n\nAfter you define filter\
        \ attributes, you can use them within your queries. For example:\n* Document-level\
        \ attribute: `doc.publication_year > 2020`\n* Part-level attribute: `part.sentiment_score\
        \ > 0.7`\n\n## Custom dimensions \nCustom dimensions let you add additional\
        \ context to your data that contain user-defined values in addition to what\
        \ Vectara automatically extracts and stores from the text. For example, *upvotes*\
        \ can be a custom dimension. For example, see [Add custom dimensions to boost\
        \ content](/docs/tutorials/add-custom-dimensions).\"\n"

        This is useful for getting information about a corpus without performing a
        search. This operation does not search the corpus contents. Specify the `corpus_key`
        to identify the corpus whose metadata you want to retrieve.


        This endpoint helps administrators understand the access control details and
        monitor the size of corpora to understand information like the amount of quota
        consumed. You can also use this information for optimizing search and storage
        utilization.


        For example, you can track the read and write activity of a specific corpus
        which can help you change your security strategy proactively. You noticed
        a corpus with an API key with read/write access that is only being used for
        high volume reads. You may decide to switch to a read-only key.


        In another case, you might respond to a security incident by disabling a specific
        corpus because of information returned by this endpoint.


        ## Get the number of documents or document parts in a corpus


        Tracking the usage of documents in a corpus enables adminstrators to manage
        resource allocation efficiently. Monitoring corpus metrics also helps data
        usage stay within allocated quotas and identify trends in document growth
        and document segmentation.


        The `limit` object in the response provides comprehensive information about
        the current usage and limits of a corpus including the number of stored documents,
        document parts, and character count.

      description: 'Retrieve statistics and value distributions for filter attributes
        in a corpus. This endpoint provides insights into the metadata structure and
        content distribution, enabling users to understand available filter values
        and build effective metadata queries.


        This endpoint analyzes document and part metadata fields defined as filter
        attributes and returns:

        - **Value distributions**: Top occurring values with their counts

        - **Statistics**: Min, max, average, and sum for numeric fields


        By default, statistics are computed across all filter attributes at both document
        and part levels. You can optionally:

        - Request statistics for specific fields only

        - Apply metadata filters to analyze a subset of the corpus

        - Limit the number of distinct values returned per field


        **Performance and Caching**: Results may be cached for improved performance,
        with cache duration varying by corpus size. Cached results can take up to
        1 hour to refresh for large corpora. Smaller corpora with faster query times
        have shorter cache durations (2-15 minutes) to ensure fresher data.


        The `corpus_key` uniquely identifies the corpus. For more information, see
        [Create a corpus](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/rest-api/create-corpus).

        \ open-source [**Vectara Ingest**](https://github.com/vectara/vectara-ingest)\
        \ Python framework. It supports connectors for websites, RSS feeds, CSV, Confluence,\
        \ HubSpot, ServiceNow, Jira, Notion, Slack, MediaWiki, GitHub, SharePoint,\
        \ Twitter/X, YouTube, and more.\n\n:::caution\nVectara Ingest is provided\
        \ as an open-source example and is not officially supported.\n:::\n\n## Multipart\
        \ form fields\n\nThis endpoint expects a `multipart/form-data` request with\
        \ the following fields:\n\n- **metadata** (optional): JSON metadata to attach\
        \ to the parsed document.  \n  Example: `metadata={\"key\":\"value\"}`\n-\
        \ **chunking_strategy** (optional): Controls how extracted text is chunked.\
        \  \n  Defaults to sentence-based chunking (one chunk per sentence).  \n \
        \ Example: `{\"type\":\"sentence_chunking_strategy\"}`. \n  Example for max\
        \ character chunking: `{\"type\":\"max_chars_chunking_strategy\",\"max_chars_per_chunk\"\
        :512}`\n- **table_extraction_config** (optional): Enables extraction of tables\
        \ from supported file types such as PDFs.  \n  Example: `{\"extract_tables\"\
        : true}`\n- **file** (required): The file to upload.\n- **filename** (required):\
        \ The desired document ID, specified within the file upload field.\n\nApart\
        \ from these parameters, the servers expect a valid JWT Token in the HTTP\
        \ headers:\n\n```curl\n\\$ curl -L -X POST 'https://api.vectara.io/v2/corpora/:corpus_key/upload_file'\
        \ \\\n-H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \\\n-H 'Accept: application/json'\

        \n```\n\n## Filenames with non-ASCII characters\n\nWhen uploading files with\
        \ non-ASCII (non-English) characters, such as Russian or Chinese, ensure that\
        \ the filename is URL encoded. The Vectara REST API follows web standards\
        \ which require URL-encoded file names.\n\n## Set the document ID\n  \nTo\
        \ set a custom Document ID, pass it as the filename in the `Content-Disposition`\
        \ header:\n\n`Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"your_document_id\"\
        `\n\nFor more information about Content-Disposition, see the [Mozilla documentation\
        \ on headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition).\n\
        \n## Attach additional metadata\n\nYou can attach additional metadata to the\
        \ file by specifying a metadata form field, which can contain a JSON string:\n\
        \n`{ \"filesize\": 1234 }`\n\n## Tabular data extraction and summarization\n\
        \nSetting `table_extraction_config.extract_tables = true` enables extraction\
        \ of tabular data (such as financial filings such as 10-K, 10-Q, S-1). You\
        \ can also apply custom prompt templates to summarize table content during\
        \ upload.\n\n:::caution\nTable extraction does not support scanned images\
        \ of tables.\n:::\n\n## Custom table summarization with prompt templates\n\
        \nVectara supports [table summarization using custom prompt templates](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/build/working-with-tables#summarize-tables-with-custom-prompts)\
        \ during document upload. This lets you define custom prompt templates that\
        \ control how the LLM interprets and summarizes table data during extraction.\
        \ By customizing the prompt_template, you can tailor summaries for domain-specific\
        \ language, analytical perspectives, or formatting preferences.\n\n## Image\
        \ support\nYou can include images in structured documents using the [Indexing\
        \ API](/docs/rest-api/create-corpus-document) with Base64 encoding. You cannot\
        \ send images directly with individual query requests. If you want to retrieve\
        \ a specific image that is embedded within a document, use the [Retrieve image\
        \ API](/docs/rest-api/get-image)\n"

      description: "Add a document to a corpus for indexing, making its content available\
        \ for search, retrieval, and generation. This endpoint supports two ingestion\
        \ modes: **structured** documents and **core** documents. These modes offer\
        \ different levels of control over document structure and chunking.\n\nEach\
        \ document becomes part of a corpus. You can use this API directly or with\
        \ [Vectara Ingest](https://github.com/vectara/vectara-ingest) or the [File\
        \ Upload API](/docs/rest-api/upload-file).\n\n## Structured documents\n\n\
        Structured documents provide a natural hierarchy where Vectar handles chunking\
        \ and metadata automatically. Structured documents are ideal when you want\
        \ to index documents that have logical organization (titles, sections, paragraphs,\
        \ and optionally tables or images) but prefer Vectara to manage how the content\
        \ is split into search-optimized units.\n\nEach structured document contains:\n\
        - A unique `id` and optional `title`, `description`, and `metadata`.\n- An\
        \ array of `sections`, each with its own title, text, and optional nested\
        \ sections, tables, or images.\n- Optional `custom_dimensions` that can influence\
        \ ranking during search.\n\nWhen indexed, Vectara partitions the text into\
        \ document parts automatically using an intelligent sentence- or character-based\
        \ chunking strategy. This lets you ingest data with minimal pre-processing\
        \ while maintaining semantic integrity across context boundaries.\n\nStructured\
        \ documents are recommended for content with well-defined sections such as\
        \ reports, articles, FAQs, or documentation.\n\n## Core documents\n\nCore\
        \ documents offer fine-grained, explicit control of every part of a document\
        \ that becomes searchable. Instead of providing a hierarchical structure,\
        \ you specify each **document part** directly as unit that maps 1:1 to a search\
        \ result or embedding.\n\nA core document includes:\n- A unique `id` and optional\
        \ `metadata`.\n- A list of `document_parts`, where each part includes `text`,\
        \ optional `context`, `metadata`, and `custom_dimensions`.\n- Optional `tables`\
        \ and `images`, allowing you to represent complex structured data like spreadsheets\
        \ or charts.\n\nCore documents are designed for advanced use cases such as\
        \ precise chunk-level optimization or experimental corpus structures, and\
        \ applications where metadata-driven retrieval or ranking must be explicitly\
        \ controlled.\n\n## Chunking strategies    \n\nBy default, Vectara uses **sentence-based\
        \ chunking**, which provides optimal retrieval accuracy for most datasets.\n\
        \nFor larger documents or performance-tuned ingestion, you can explicitly\
        \ set a `chunking_strategy`:\n- `sentence_chunking_strategy` \u2014 creates\
        \ one chunk per sentence (default).\n- `max_chars_chunking_strategy` \u2014\
        \ creates larger chunks up to a specified character limit (`max_chars_per_chunk`),\
        \ balancing retrieval speed with contextual coherence.\n"

      description: "Organizations often struggle with extracting relevant insights\
        \ from extensive documentation, such as vendor quotes, financial statements,\
        \ and technical reports. Manually reviewing these documents is both time-consuming\
        \ and prone to errors. \n\nThe tech preview of the Documentation Summarization\
        \ API enables users to generate concise summaries that capture essential insights\
        \ from single documents without having to process entire documents manually.\
        \ Efficiently process large documents, extract key insights, and interact\
        \ with real-time data summaries.\n\n* Enable streaming for large documents\
        \ to receive summaries incrementally.\n* Customize `prompt_template` to fine-tune\
        \ summary output for specific domains.\n* Use standard responses for small\
        \ documents where streaming is unnecessary.\n* Monitor streaming events to\
        \ track the progress of real-time summarization.\n\n:::note\nThe documentation\
        \ length is limited by the context window of your selected LLM.\n:::\n\n##\
        \ Response formats\n\nThe API supports two response modes:\n\n* **Standard**:\
        \ Provides a complete summary in one response.\n* **Streaming** Provides incremental\
        \ responses using Server-Sent Events (SSE).\n\n### Non-streaming response\n\
        \nIn standard mode, the API returns a structured response containing the complete\
        \ summary of the document. The summary field contains the generated text,\
        \ enabling users to extract essential information quickly.\n\n### Streaming\
        \ response\n\nFor streaming responses, the API returns Server-Sent Events\
        \ (SSE). The first event begins streaming partial results as soon as they\
        \ are available, while the final event marks the end of the summarization\
        \ process.\n\nThe streamed response consists of multiple events:\n\n* `generation_info`:\
        \ Contains the `rendered_prompt` which is the compiled prompt sent to the\
        \ LLM for document summarization.\n* `generation_chunk`: Returns partial chunk\
        \ of the generated summary.\n* `generation_end`: Marks the completion of the\
        \ summary generation.\n* `error`: Returns an error message if summarization\
        \ fails.\n* `end`: Indicates the end of the streaming session.\n\n## Prompt\
        \ template example\n\nWhen crafting a prompt, you can access your document\
        \ with the `$vectaraDocument` field. This example shows a simple prompt:\n\
        \n```json\n{\n  \"role\": \"user\",\n  \"content\": \"Summarize the document:\
        \ \\$vectaraDocument.json()\"\n}\n```\nThe document also has the following\
        \ methods to support custom prompts. \n\n* `$vectaraDocument.json()`: Provides\
        \ a JSON representation of the whole document.\n* `$vectaraDocument.id()`:\
        \ Specifies the unique identifier of the document (`document_id`)\n* `$vectaraDocument.metadata()`:\
        \ Specifies metadata from the document.  \n  For example, \n  `$vectaraDocument.metadata().get(\"\
        key\")` retrieves a specific metadata value by key.\n* `$vectaraDocument.parts()`:\
        \ Returns an array of document parts which you can look through.  \n  For\
        \ example, `#foreach ($part in $vectaraDocument.parts())`.  \n* `$part.text()`:\
        \ Retrieves the text of the part.\n* `$part.metadata()`: Retrieves metadata\
        \ of a part.\n* `$part.hasTable()`: Determines if the part contains a table.\n\
        * `$part.table()`: Provides access to the table within the part. For example,\
        \ use `$part.table().json()` to retrieve the table in JSON format.\n"

        Augmented Generation (RAG), allowing you to search your data and generate
        AI-powered summaries. Vectara provides three query types to match different
        search needs:


        * [**Single corpus query**](/docs/rest-api/search-corpus): For a simple search
        within a single data source.

        * [**Advanced single corpus query**](/docs/rest-api/query-corpus): For full-featured
        search and RAG within one corpus, supporting advanced features like table
        summarization, metadata filtering, and reranking.

        * [**Multiple corpora query**](/docs/rest-api/query): For searching across
        one or more corpora with full RAG capabilities.


        Search a single corpus with a straightforward query request, specifying the
        corpus key and query parameters.


        * Specify the unique `corpus_key` identifying the corpus to query. The `corpus_key`
        is created in the Vectara Console or the [Create Corpus API](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/rest-api/create-corpus),
        and the corpus key is part of that process. When creating a new corpus, you
        have the option to assign a custom `corpus_key` following your preferred naming
        convention. This key serves as a unique identifier for the corpus, allowing
        it to be referenced in search requests.

        * Enter the search `query` string for the corpus, which is the question you
        want to ask.

        * Set the maximum number of results (`limit`) to return. **Default**: 10,
        **minimum**: 1

      description: "Perform an advanced query on a specific corpus to find relevant\
        \ results, generate summaries, highlight relevant snippets, and use Retrieval\
        \ Augmented Generation.\n\nThis endpoint expands on the simple GET version\
        \ by allowing full customization of:\n- **Search parameters**: Control pagination\
        \ (`offset`, `limit`), apply metadata filters, and specify lexical interpolation\
        \ to balance neural and keyword-based retrieval.\n- **Hybrid search**: Adjust\
        \ the `lexical_interpolation` value between `0.0` (purely neural) and `1.0`\
        \ (purely lexical). Typical best results are between `0.01` and `0.1`.\n-\
        \ **Reranking**: Apply advanced rerankers such as Multilingual, MMR, Chain,\
        \ or User Defined Function rerankers to improve result relevance.\n- **Generation\
        \ (RAG)**: Include a `generation` object to enable grounded summarization\
        \ with your own data, citations, and factual consistency scoring.\n- **Streaming**:\
        \ Optionally stream results or generated summaries in real time with `stream_response`.\n\
        \nEach query must include the `corpus_key` path parameter that identifies\
        \ the target corpus. The response contains one or more subdocuments representing\
        \ the most relevant passages, along with any generated summaries or citations.\n\
        \n**Typical use cases**\n- Perform a semantically rich search over a large,\
        \ domain-specific corpus.\n- Retrieve relevant text passages and apply reranking\
        \ for better result diversity.\n- Generate contextually grounded answers or\
        \ summaries using Retrieval Augmented Generation.\n\n## Basic query\n\nThis\
        \ basic query example has a minimal configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"query\"\
        : \"What are black holes?\",\n  \"search\": {\n    \"corpora\": [{\n     \
        \ \"corpus_key\": \"my-corpus\" \n    }],\n  },\n  \"generation\": {\n   \
        \ \"generation_preset_name\": \"mockingbird-2.0\",\n    \"max_used_search_results\"\
        : 20 \n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Request body parameters\n\nThe request body is a\

        \ of the retrieved context (e.g., <b>).\n* `end_tag` (string): HTML-style\
        \ tag to wrap the end of the retrieved context (e.g., </b>).\n:::note\nYou\
        \ can only use sentences before/after OR characters before/after, but not\
        \ both.\n:::\n\nExample:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"context_configuration\": {\n \
        \   \"sentences_before\": 2,\n    \"sentences_after\": 2,\n    \"start_tag\"\
        : \"<mark>\",\n    \"end_tag\": \"</mark>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`search.reranker`\
        \ (object, optional) - Configures a reranker to improve result quality by\
        \ reordering search results to place the most relevant content first. For\
        \ more details, see [Reranking overview](/docs/search-and-retrieval/rerankers/reranking-overview).\n\
        * `type` (string): The reranker type. Options include customer_reranker (default\
        \ multilingual reranker), mmr (for result diversity), or none.\n* `reranker_name`\
        \ (string): The specific reranker model to use (e.g., Rerank_Multilingual_v1).\n\
        * `limit` (integer): Maximum number of results to return after reranking.\n\
        * `cutoff` (float): Minimum relevance score (between 0.0 and 1.0) for a result\
        \ to be included. A typical range is 0.3-0.7.\n* `include_context` (boolean):\
        \ If true, uses surrounding context text for more accurate reranking.\n\n\
        **Example:**\n\n`json\n{\n  \"reranker\": {\n    \"type\": \"customer_reranker\"\
        ,\n    \"reranker_name\": \"Rerank_Multilingual_v1\",\n    \"limit\": 50,\n\
        \  }\n}\n```\n\n`generation` (object, optional) - An object that controls\
        \ how the agent creates natural language responses. If this object is excluded,\
        \ summarization is disabled.\n\n`generation.generation_preset_name` (string,\
        \ optional) - The name of the pre-configured prompt and LLM bundle.\n\n**Recommended\
        \ Presets:**\n\n* `mockingbird-2.0`: Vectara's cutting-edge LLM for RAG.\n\
        * `vectara-summary-ext-24-05-med-omni`: (gpt-4o, optimized for citations)\n\
        * `vectara-summary-ext-24-05-large`: (gpt-4.0-turbo, optimized for citations)\n\
        * `vectara-summary-ext-24-05-sml`: (gpt-3.5-turbo, optimized for citations)\n\
        \n\n**For Tabular data:**\n\n`vectara-summary-table-query-ext-dec-2024-gpt-4o`\n\
        \n`generation.prompt_template` (string, optional) - A custom prompt template\
        \ in JSON format that defines the system and user messages for the LLM. Use\
        \ this to customize the behavior of the model beyond the preset. The template\
        \ can include Velocity templates with variables such as `$vectaraQueryResults`\
        \ to reference retrieved search results. For more information, see [Custom\
        \ prompts](/docs/prompts/vectara-prompt-engine).\n\n`generation.max_used_search_results`\
        \ (integer, optional) - The maximum number of top search results to send for\
        \ summarization. The number of top search results to send to the LLM for summarization.\
        \ Increasing this can create a more comprehensive summary but may increase\
        \ response time. **Default limit**: 25.\n\n:::caution\nSetting this value\
        \ too high may prevent the model from generating a response.\n:::\n\n`generation.response_language`\
        \ (string, optional) - The language code for the response (e.g. `eng`, `spa`,\
        \ `deu`). Set this to `auto` to have Vectara guess the language, but we recommend\
        \ specifying your preferred language for best results.\n\n`generation.citations`\
        \ (object, optional) - Configuration for including citations in the generated\
        \ summary.\n* `style` (string): Citation style. Options are `markdown`, `html`,\
        \ or `none`.\n* `url_pattern` (string): A URL template for citation links,\
        \ where `{doc.id}` will be replaced with the document ID.\n* `text_pattern`\
        \ (string): A text template for citation display, where `{doc.title}` will\
        \ be replaced with the document title.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"\
        citations\": {\n    \"style\": \"markdown\",\n    \"url_pattern\": \"https://docs.example.com/documents/{doc.id}\"\
        ,\n    \"text_pattern\": \"{doc.title}\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`generation.model_parameters`\
        \ (object, optional) - Custom parameters for the underlying LLM that overwrites\
        \ the defaults of `generation_preset_name`.\n* `temperature` (float): Controls\
        \ randomness in the output. Higher values (e.g., 0.8) produce more creative\
        \ results, while lower values (e.g., 0.2) yield more focused and deterministic\
        \ outputs.\n* `max_tokens` (integer): The maximum number of tokens to generate\
        \ in the response.\n* `frequency_penalty` (float): Decreases the use of repeating\
        \ words, reducing repetition. **Default**: `0.0` to `1.0`.\n* `presence_penalty`\
        \ (float): Increases the chance for the model to introduce new topics. **Default**:\
        \ `0.0` to `1.0`.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"model_parameters\": {\n\
        \    \"temperature\": 0.7,\n    \"max_tokens\": 500,\n    \"frequency_penalty\"\
        : 0.5,\n    \"presence_penalty\": 0.3\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`generation.enable_factual_consistency_score`\
        \ (boolean): If true, includes a factual consistency score in the response\
        \ to indicate how well the generated summary aligns with the retrieved documents.\n"

      description: 'Perform a multipurpose query to retrieve relevant information
        from one or more corpora and generate a response using Retrieval Augmented
        Generation (RAG). Similar to the [advanced corpora search](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/rest-api/query-corpus).


        * Specify the unique `corpus_key` identifying the corpus to query. The `corpus_key`
        is created in the Vectara Console or the [Create Corpus API](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/rest-api/create-corpus),
        and the corpus key is part of that process. When creating a new corpus, you
        have the option to assign a custom `corpus_key` following your preferred naming
        convention. This key serves as a unique identifier for the corpus, allowing
        it to be referenced in search requests.

        * Customize your search by specifying the query text (`query`), pagination
        details (`offset` and `limit`), and metadata filters (`metadata_filter`) to
        tailor your search results.

        * Leverage advanced search capabilities like reranking (`reranker`) and opt-in
        Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) (`generation`) for enhanced query performance.
        Generation is opt-in by setting the `generation` property. By excluding the
        property or by setting it to null, the response will not include generation.
        [Learn more](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/grounded-generation/configure-query-summarization)

        * Specify Vectara''s RAG-focused LLM (Mockingbird) for the `generation_preset_name`.
        [Learn more](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/mockingbird-llm)

        * Use advanced summarization options that utilize detailed summarization parameters
        such as `max_response_characters`, `temperature`, and `frequency_penalty`
        for generating precise and relevant summaries. [Learn more](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/search-and-retrieval#advanced-summarization-customization-options)

        * Customize citation formats in summaries using the `citations` object to
        include numeric, HTML, or Markdown links. [Learn more](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/search-and-retrieval#citations)

      description: "The Chat Completions API provides an OpenAI-compatible interface\
        \ for generating model responses in multi-turn chat conversations. This API\
        \ enables you to integrate our language models directly into applications\
        \ designed to work with the OpenAI Chat Completions format, making it easy\
        \ to leverage Vectara capabilities with minimal changes to existing tools\
        \ or code.\n\nUse this API to enable interactive chat experiences that support\
        \ context-aware responses, streaming output, and token usage tracking.\n\n\
        The request includes a series of chat messages and optional parameters that\
        \ control the behavior and structure of the model response. The request body\
        \ must include the `messages` parameter, an array of message objects (role,\
        \ content) representing the full conversation so far.\n\n### Streaming responses\n\
        \nIf the `stream` parameter is set to `true`, the response appears as a series\
        \ of text/event-stream parts (also known as chunks). Each chunk includes a\
        \ `delta` field showing the incremental message update.\n\n### Example request\n\
        \nThis example sends a simple chat conversation to the API, asking the assistant\
        \ for the capital of France. The request includes a system prompt, a user\
        \ message, and a temperature setting for response variability.\n```json\n\

        \ 0.7,\n\"stream\": false\n}\n```\n\n### Example response\nThe response includes\
        \ a generated reply from the assistant, along with token usage statistics.\
        \ In this example, the model returns a direct answer to a user question.\n\

      description: 'Organizations often struggle to fine-tune query responses and
        maintain consistency across different use cases. Vectara creates and maintains
        predefined generation presets for our users which provides a flexible and
        powerful way to utilize generation parameters. Each preset includes a complete
        Velocity template for the prompt along with other generation parameters. Presets
        are typically associated with a single LLM.


        The List Generation Presets API lets you view the generation presets used
        for [query](/docs/rest-api/queries) requests. Generation presets group several
        properties that configure generation for a request. These presets provide
        more flexibility in how generation parameters are configured, enabling more
        fine-tuned control over query responses.


        This includes the `prompt_template`, the Large Language Model (LLM), and other
        generation settings like `max_tokens` and `temperature`. Users specify a generation
        preset in their query or chat requests using the `generation_preset_name`
        field.


        ## Generation presets object


        The `generation_presets` object contains the `name`, `description`, `llm_name`,
        `prompt_template`, and other fields make up the preset.


        If your account has access to a preset, then `enabled` is set to `true`. A
        preset can also be set as a `default`.\n\n### Example generation presets response\n\n```json\n{\n  \"generation_presets\":

      description: 'The Hallucination Correctors API enables users to automatically
        detect and correct factual inaccuracies, commonly referred to as hallucinations,
        in generated summaries or responses. By comparing a user-provided summary
        against one or more source documents, the API returns a corrected version
        of the summary with minimal necessary edits.


        Use this API to validate and improve the factual accuracy of summaries generated
        by LLMs in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, ensuring that the
        output remains grounded in trusted source content. If HCM does not detect
        hallucination, it preserves the original summary.


        The response corrects the original summary. If the input summary is accurate,
        the `corrected_summary` matches the `original_summary`.


        ## Interpreting empty corrections


        In some cases, the `corrected_text` field in the response may be an empty
        string. This indicates VHC determined that the entire input text was hallucinated,
        and VHC recommends removing it completely.


        This outcome is valid and typically occurs when none of the content in the
        `generated_text` is supported by the provided source documents or query. The
        response still includes an explanation of why VHC removed the text.

      description: "Create a new agent. An agent is compromised as 3 main things of\
        \ functionality:\n  1. The **instructions** an agent follows. Known as a system\
        \ in prompt in other platforms.\n  2. The **steps** an agent follows when\
        \ receiving an input.\n  3. The **tools** an agent can use to resolve those\
        \ steps and instructions.\n\nInstructions are tied to each step, and should\
        \ be precisely crafted so that the agent can perform the desired actions when\
        \ given an input. \n\n:::tip Creating more precise instructions\nBe specific\
        \ to exactly what you want the agent to do. For emphasis, use CAPS if you\
        \ want the agent to follow a specific format. Negative prompts also help with\
        \ precision such as saying **DO NOT DO THIS**.\n:::\n\nTo use an agent, create\
        \ a new session (called thread or chat in other platforms), and send new inputs\
        \ to the agent to get responses.\n\n:::note\nOnly a single step is supported\
        \ with no follow up steps. So the `first_step` will be only the only step.\
        \ We will add multiple steps and step types to execute complex workflows,\
        \ but many agents can work well with a single step.\n:::\n\n## LLM configuration\n\
        \nAgents use LLMs for reasoning and response generation. You can configure\
        \ the following:\n- **Model**: Choose from available models like GPT-4o.\n\
        - **Parameters**: Adjust temperature, max tokens, and other model-specific\
        \ settings.\n- **Cost optimization**: Balance performance with token usage.\n\
        - **Retry configuration**: Configure automatic retry behavior for transient\
        \ failures.\n\n## Using retries to improve user experience\n\nWhen agents\
        \ interact with LLMs, transient failures like network interruptions can disrupt\
        \ communication between the agent and the LLM. You can configure your agent\
        \ to resume disrupted communication to ensure a smooth user experience.\n\
        - `max_retries`: After an error, the agent will retry its request to the LLM\
        \ this many times.\n- `initial_backoff_ms`: This is how many milliseconds\
        \ the agent will wait before retrying, to give the cause of the error time\
        \ to resolve.\n- `backoff_factor`: Every time the agent retries, it can multiply\
        \ the last retry delay by this number, increasing the wait between retries.\
        \ This is like giving a toddler a longer and longer timeout if it continues\
        \ to misbehave.\n- `max_backoff_ms`: The maximum time you want the agent to\
        \ wait between retries, so the backoff_factor does not create an unreasonably\
        \ long delay for your users.\n"

      description: "Create a new session for interacting with an agent. A session\
        \ is the conversation container that maintains state across all messages,\
        \ events, tool use, and agent responses.\n\nThis endpoint initializes the\
        \ session and enables you to configure its initial properties, including optional\
        \ metadata. Metadata can influence agent behavior, personalize responses,\
        \ or apply access controls. Instructions and tools can also reference metadata\
        \ using `${\\session.metadata.field}` or `$\\ref` syntax.\n\nA session also\
        \ serves as the workspace for artifacts, enabling file uploads and multi-step\
        \ workflows. For more information, see [Working with artifacts in sessions](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/agents/sessions#working-with-artifacts-in-sessions).\n\

    ArtifactReference:
      title: ArtifactReference
      description: 'Reference to an artifact stored in the agent session workspace.


        Artifacts are files or documents that belong to a specific agent session,
        providing a persistent workspace where agents and users can share files throughout
        a conversation. When users upload files (such as PDFs, Word documents, PowerPoint
        presentations, or images) to an agent session, these files are stored as artifacts
        that remain available for the duration of the session.


        **Session Binding**: Each artifact is scoped to a specific agent session and
        cannot be accessed from other sessions, ensuring data privacy and security.


        **Lifecycle**: Artifacts are created when users upload files via multipart
        requests or when agent tools generate new files (such as converting a PDF
        to markdown). Artifacts have a configurable time-to-live and are automatically
        removed when they expire or when the session is deleted. Size limits apply
        to individual artifacts and total session storage.


        **How Agents Use Artifacts**: Agent tools can read artifacts, process them,
        and create new derived artifacts. For example, the document conversion tool
        can take a PDF artifact, convert it to markdown, and store the result as a
        new artifact. This enables multi-step document processing workflows within
        a single session.


        **Common Use Cases**: Upload a document for the agent to analyze, provide
        multiple reference files for context, enable the agent to convert between
        formats, or allow the agent to generate and store processed files for later
        retrieval.

    ArtifactUploadEvent:
      title: ArtifactUploadEvent
      description: 'Event representing files uploaded to the agent workspace as artifacts.


        This event is created when users upload one or more files to an agent session
        using multipart requests. The event becomes part of the session''s conversation
        history and contains references to all artifacts that were uploaded in the
        request. Each uploaded file is assigned a unique artifact identifier and stored
        in the session''s workspace.


        When an agent processes this event, it becomes aware that new files are available
        in the session and can use various tools to read, analyze, or transform these
        artifacts. For example, after receiving an artifact upload event with a PDF,
        the agent might use the document conversion tool to extract and analyze the
        document''s contents.


        See the `ArtifactReference` schema for comprehensive details about what artifacts
        are, how they are stored, their lifecycle, and how agents interact with them.
