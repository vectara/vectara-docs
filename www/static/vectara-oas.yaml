            Since the indexer is idempotent, the same document (identified by the document ID) can be uploaded multiple times.
            The indexer does not support updates yet, so an error is returned when a different document is uploaded for the same document ID
            Note that when a raw file is uploaded, the file name is used as the document ID.

          description: >-
            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized

            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]


              value in binary format, or produce an error.
            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the


              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
              breaking changes.)

            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

            type.googleapis.com.


            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

            used with implementation specific semantics.

      description: >-
        `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a

        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.



            Foo foo = ...;
            Any any;
            any.PackFrom(foo);
            ...
            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
              ...
            }

        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.



            Foo foo = ...;
            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
            ...
            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
            }

        Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.



            foo = Foo(...)
            any = Any()
            any.Pack(foo)
            ...
            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
              any.Unpack(foo)
              ...

        Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go



             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
             if err != nil {
               ...
             }
             ...
             foo := &pb.Foo{}
             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
               ...
             }

        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

        name "y.z".



        JSON


        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:



            package google.profile;
            message Person {
              string first_name = 1;
              string last_name = 2;
            }

            {
              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
              "firstName": <string>,
              "lastName": <string>
            }

        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):



            {
              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
              "value": "1.212s"
            }
