VectarIta is a neural search platform, built for developers\nto get the most out of their data.\n\nYou can [sign up for an account](https://vectara.com) and \nthen view several [API Recipes](/docs/api-recipes) with example queries \nand parameter values.\n\n:::note\n\nAPI Keys can be used for querying and indexing operations, but cannot at this \ntime be used for administrative operations such as creating or deleting \ncorpora. These operations authenticate with a Bearer Token via the \nOAuth 2.0 client credentials grant.

        Creates a corpus, which is a container to store data in.

        Some tips for this API:
        * This operation only works with OAuth 2.0 (in a JWT "Bearer Token") authentication. It does not work with API Keys.  You can find details of how to set up and use OAuth 2.0 [here](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/authentication/oauth-2).
        * The `name` of the corpus is the only required field.
        * Filter attributes tell Vectara which metadata fields you'd like to run SQL-style filters against.  If you need to change them after you've created the corpus, see the [Replace Filter Attributes API](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/rest-api/replace-corpus-filter-attrs)
        * `textless` and `customDimensions` are features that are only available to [Scale](https://vectara.com/pricing/) accounts.

This mug is the ultimate in technological sophistication and gourmet taste. It will make your coffee so good that you'll never want to drink anything else again. And if you're worried about the so-called 'risks' of using a fusion reactor to heat your beverage, well, maybe you're just not cut out for the high-stakes world of elite coffee connoisseurship. So go ahead and stick with your bland, boring, non-nuclear coffee mugs. We'll be over here, sipping the sweet nectar of the gods from our Fusion-Powered Perfection mugs."

        This is the "standard" Indexing API for indexing semi-structured, text-heavy "documents."  Indexing data into Vectara is typically very fast: within a few seconds.

        Some tips for this API:
        * This operation authenticates with either an API Key or OAuth 2.0 (in a JWT "Bearer Token"). You can find details of how to set up an API key or use OAuth 2.0 [here](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/console-ui/manage-api-access).
        * Vectara does require a special format for JSON objects you'd like to index.  Some tips on how to model data in the indexing API, see the documentation [here](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/document-data-structuring).
        * The `metadataJson` object needs the JSON to be escaped so that it's not confused with other parts of the request JSON.
        * [Custom dimensions](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/semantic-search/add-custom-dimensions) (`customDims`) is a feature that is only available to [Scale](https://vectara.com/pricing/) accounts.

        Some tips for this API:
        * This operation only works with OAuth 2.0 (in a JWT "Bearer Token") authentication. It does not work with API Keys.  You can find details of how to set up and use OAuth 2.0 [here](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/authentication/oauth-2).
        * It's best practice to filter as much as possible (by date, by status, and/or by job ID) to make job lists as easy to interpret as possible, as there can be many for a given time window.

        [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/grounded-generation/grounded-generation-overview) (RAG).

        Some tips for this API:
        * This operation authenticates with either an API Key or OAuth 2.0 (in a JWT "Bearer Token"). You can find details of how to set up an API key or use OAuth 2.0 [here](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/console-ui/manage-api-access).
        * By default, Vectara only uses its neural/semantic retrieval model, and does not attempt to use keyword matching.  To enable hybrid search with a mix of both keyword and neural results, edit the `lambda` value.  Additional documentation on hybrid search is [here](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/semantic-search/hybrid-search).
        * Vectara can automatically provide a generative summary with the query results for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).  Additional details on RAG in Vectara can be found [here](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/grounded-generation/grounded-generation-overview).
        * The Query API takes an *array* of queries, since you can have Vectara perform more than 1 query in a single API call.  The results that are returned are thus in an array as well, with each element in the response array corresponding to the input query array.
        * Custom dimensions (the `dim` array) is a feature that is only available to [Scale](https://vectara.com/pricing/) accounts.

        Updates the [filterable metadata fields](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/metadata-search-filtering/filter-overview) for the corpus.

        Some tips for this API:
        * This operation only works with OAuth 2.0 (in a JWT "Bearer Token") authentication. It does not work with API Keys.  You can find details of how to set up and use OAuth 2.0 [here](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/authentication/oauth-2).
        * Each request to replace the corpus filter attributes kicks off a background [job](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/rest-api/list-jobs).  The job ID is returned when you kick off a metadata filter update job so you can track it later.
        * Existing filters will continue to apply until the update job completes.
        * The time that update filter jobs take is roughly proportional to the size of the corpus.  Updates on small corpora generally take a few minutes at most, but updates on large corpora can take many minutes to hours to complete.

        This API is intended to be used by experts.  It gives you fine-grained control over chunking
        strategies by using the `parts`.  Most users will want to use the [File Upload API](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/rest-api/file-upload) or the "standard" [Index API](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/rest-api/index).

        Some tips for this API:
        * This operation authenticates with either an API Key or OAuth 2.0 (in a JWT "Bearer Token"). You can find details of how to set up an API key or use OAuth 2.0 [here](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/console-ui/manage-api-access).
        * The `metadataJson` object needs the JSON to be escaped so that it's not confused with other parts of the request JSON.
        * [Custom dimensions](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/semantic-search/add-custom-dimensions) (`customDims`) is a feature that is only available to [Scale](https://vectara.com/pricing/) accounts.

        The File Upload API can be used to index binary files like PDFs, Word Documents, and similar.
        Vectara will attempt to automatically extract the text and any metadata from the document like
        author or title, though you can provide additional metadata as well.

        Some tips for this API:
        * This operation authenticates with either an API Key or OAuth 2.0 (in a JWT "Bearer Token"). You can find details of how to set up an API key or use OAuth 2.0 [here](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/console-ui/manage-api-access).
        * You can find a full list of supported file formats [here](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/api-reference/indexing-apis/file-upload/file-upload-filetypes).
        * To provide additional metadata, set the `doc_metadata` field.  You can find some additional details [here](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/api-reference/indexing-apis/file-upload/file-upload#attach-additional-metadata)
        * PDFs must contain text: Vectara does not currently support indexing scanned images via OCR.

          description: >-
            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized

            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]





              value in binary format, or produce an error.
            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the





              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
              breaking changes.)

            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

            type.googleapis.com.


            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

            used with implementation specific semantics.

      description: >-
        `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a

        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.






            Foo foo = ...;
            Any any;
            any.PackFrom(foo);
            ...
            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
              ...
            }

        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.






            Foo foo = ...;
            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
            ...
            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
            }

        Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.






            foo = Foo(...)
            any = Any()
            any.Pack(foo)
            ...
            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
              any.Unpack(foo)
              ...

        Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go






             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
             if err != nil {
               ...
             }
             ...
             foo := &pb.Foo{}
             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
               ...
             }

        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

        name "y.z".



        JSON


        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:






            package google.profile;
            message Person {
              string first_name = 1;
              string last_name = 2;
            }

            {
              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
              "firstName": <string>,
              "lastName": <string>
            }

        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):






            {
              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
              "value": "1.212s"
            }
