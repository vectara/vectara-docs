The React-Search component queries your Vectara data and adds semantic
search to your React apps with a few lines of code. [Interact with the
demo](https://vectara.github.io/react-search/) to see how it works.

[Go to the code repository](https://github.com/vectara/react-search) for information about
how to use React-Search.
