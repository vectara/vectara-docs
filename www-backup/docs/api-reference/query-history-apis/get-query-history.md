The Get Query History API allows you to retrieve detailed history about a 
specific query that was made against a corpus. The response includes detailed 
information about the query, such as latency, the time it was executed, and 
the various stages in the query pipeline.

## Get Query History Request and Response

To get a history of a specific query, send a GET request to 
`/v2/queries/{query_id}`. You specify the `query_id` and the response includes 
the `id` of the query, the `query` object, the `chat_id`, the time taken to 
complete the query (`latency_ms`) the time that the query `started_at`, along 
with the `spans` object.

The `spans` object provides information about the ordered parts of the query 
pipeline and you get information about what happens during each stage of the 
pipeline.
