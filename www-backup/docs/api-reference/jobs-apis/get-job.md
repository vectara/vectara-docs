The Get Job API retrieves details about a specific job by `job_id`. Jobs are
background processes like replacing the filterable metadata attributes of a
corpus.

## Get Job Request and Response

To get details about a specific job, send a GET request to `/v2/jobs/{job_id}`,
where `{job_id}` is the unique identifier of the job you want to retrieve.
The `job_id` is the string that was returned when the job was created; for
example when replacing filter attributes on a corpus.
