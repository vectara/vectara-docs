In collaboration with the larger generative AI community, Vectara integrates 
with other systems that empower developers to enhance their AI applications. 
Vectara's advanced capabilities in retrieval, generative summarization and 
hallucination reduction help unlock a new level of accuracy and trust for AI 
assistants and agents.

The integrations fall into a few categories:
1. **Data Ingest tools:** Our integrations with Airbyte, Unstructured, and DataVolo 
   empower developers to build their data ingest pipeline that continuously updates 
   their data assets (from hundreds of possible enterprise data sources) into Vectara
   using these offerings, which offer off-the-shelf integration with hundreds 
   of data sources.
2. **LLM orchestration:** For developers that are already building with LangChain or 
   LlamaIndex, Vectara is fully integrated to enable efficient and 
   low-latency RAG that can plug into your generative AI applications.
3. **Low-code / no-code app builders:** Vectara is fully integrated with both 
   Flowise and LangFlow, two of the leading products offering a no-code and 
   drag-and-drop interface for building LLM applications.

:::note
These third-party integrations are not officially supported by Vectara. Users 
may need to seek community support or external resources for assistance and 
updates.
