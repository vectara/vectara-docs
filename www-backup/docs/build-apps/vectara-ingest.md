Vectara Ingest crawls datasets from pre-built crawlers (websites, RSS feeds, 
Jira, Notion, Docusaurus) and ingests them into Vectara. This sample ingestion 
framework includes preconfigured templates for pulling data from many popular 
data sources.

[Go to the code repository](https://github.com/vectara/vectara-ingest) for information about 
how to use Vectara Ingest.
