Metadata filters enable highly versatile and granular control over query 
results. This section provides real-world examples and use cases to illustrate 
how metadata filters can be applied to solve common business and technical 
challenges.

## Language-specific filtering

In multilingual documents, different sections may be in different languages. 
Use part-level metadata to target specific language segments.

**Example: **Filter for German-language customer reviews with a rating higher 
than 3 stars.

```sql
doc.rating > 3 AND part.lang = 'de'
```

The `lang` metadata tag used in this example is detected and set automatically 
by the platform at indexing time. It's set at the part level for accuracy, 
because a single document may contain content in multiple languages.


## Date-specific document retrieval

More complicated expressions are possible, such as the one below, which checks 
for documents with a publication date in 2021.

**Example:** Retrieve documents published in 2021 using epoch time.

```sql
1609459200 < doc.pub_epoch AND doc.pub_epoch < 1640995200
```
Here, `pub_epoch` stores the date in [epoch time][3].

You can find a full list of supported operations on the [Functions and Operators][2]
page, and a full list of how to specify literals on [Data Types][5].

## Filter by document status

For auditing purposes, you may want to limit results to documents marked as 
`Published` instead of `Draft`:

`doc.status = 'Published'`

## Filter by custom tag

Custom metadata fields enable filtering based on business-specific criteria, 
such as priority, category, or internal tags.

**Example:** Filter documents tagged as **High Priority** in the **Technology** 
category.

```sql
doc.priority = 'High' AND doc.category = 'Technology'
```
## Example query with a document-level filter

This example asks the question `"What are the key benefits of cloud computing?"` 
from the Cloud Computing References corpus. Within the `corpora` object, we 
specified a `metadata_filter` to filter though published documents with 
`"metadata_filter": "doc.status = 'Published'",`

```json
curl -X POST \
-H "customer-id: 123456789" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ...nMRNknvg"  \
https://api.vectara.io:443/v2/query \
-d @- <<END;
{
  "query": "What are key benefits of cloud computing?",
  "search": {
    "corpora": [
      {
        "corpus_key": "Cloud_Computing_References",
        "metadata_filter": "doc.status = 'Published'",
        "lexical_interpolation": 0.005,
        "custom_dimensions": {}
      }

    },
    "reranker": {

    "prompt_text": "",

    "enable_factual_consistency_score": true
  }
}
END
```

## Example response with a document-level filter

The example response returns documents with a `"status": "Published",` in the document 
metadata. This response also shows other metadata associated with each `document_id`.

```json

## Example query with part-level metadata

Now let's send a query with part-level meta for `part.concept = 'Overview'`.

We will only change the `metadata_filter` value from the previous example so 
that it filters for this part-level metadata:

```json
"corpora": [
      {
        "corpus_key": "Cloud_Computing_References",
        "metadata_filter": "part.concept = 'Overview'",
        "lexical_interpolation": 0.005,
        "custom_dimensions": {}
      }
```

## Example response with part-level metadata

```json
[
    {
        "type": "search_results",
        "search_results": [
            {

                "score": 0.8265947103500366,
