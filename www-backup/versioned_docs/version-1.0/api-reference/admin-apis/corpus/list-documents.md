The List Documents API lets you view the Document IDs and their metadata 
in a corpus. This is useful for viewing documents indexed so far and helping 
you decide to remove documents that are no longer needed. It helps you manage 
the document lifecycle in your enviroment.

This information enables you to catalog and inventory large amounts of data 
while also extracting lists of documents for further analysis. For example, 
developers can utilize the metadata to to build custom search and filtering 
capabilities into their applications.

Check out our [**interactive API Playground**](/docs/1.0/rest-api/list-documents) that lets you experiment with this 
REST endpoint to list your documents.
