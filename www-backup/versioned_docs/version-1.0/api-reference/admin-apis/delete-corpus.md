The Delete Corpus API lets you delete a corpus. To delete a corpus, specify 
the `customer_id` and `corpus_id`. Upon successful completion, space quota 
consumed by the corpus will be freed, and the corpus will no longer be useable 
for future indexing or querying. 

:::note

The corpus_id assigned to the corpus will not be reused.
