Reranking involves a process of rescoring and refining an initial set of query 
results to achieve a more precise ranking. It employs a machine learning model 
that while slower than the rapid retrieval step, offers more accurate results. 
We currently have two rerankers, the English reranker and the Maximal Marginal 
Relevance (MMR) reranker.

## English Cross-attentional Reranker (Scale Only)

The English cross-attentional reranker is only available to Scale users and you enable it by 
specifying `272725717` as the `reranker_id`.

In most scenarios, it makes sense to use the default query `start` value of `0` so 
that you're reranking all of the best initial results. You can also set 
`numResults` to the total number of documents you wish to rerank. The
default value is `10`.

## Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) Reranker

The Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) reranker enables you to diversify search 
results to reduce redundancy while maintaining relevance to the query. 
Search queries often result in a collection of similar documents that, while 
relevant, may lack variety. MMR addresses this by reranking the results to 
include documents that are both relevant to your query but also different 
from the documents already listed in the search results. This approach 
provides users with a more balanced set of results as they may show 
different perspectives related to your query.

You enable the MMR reranker by specifying the `reranker_id` as `272725718`. 
Having a diverse set of relevant results has different benefits depending on 
the use case:
* In a pure search scenario, it improves user engagement with results by 
  avoiding repetition.
* In a generative AI scenario, it produces more comprehensive summaries.
* Diversifying results can potentially represent all points of view in the 
  data or reduce bias.

In addition to specifying the `reranker_id` as `272725718` at query time, you also 
specify a `diversity bias` range between `0.0` and `1.0`. Values closer to `1.0` 
optimize for the most diverse results. 

You can also enable the Maximal Marginal Relevance Reranker in the Console 
UI as follows:

1. Open a corpus from the list and select the **Query** tab.
2. Click **Configure retrieval** and a navigation drawer opens.
3. Enable the **Rerank search results** option.

4. Enter a value between `0.0` and `1.0` in the `Diversity factor` field.
5. Close the Configure retrieval drawer and click **Reload results**.

By applying the MMR Reranker to queries, users get results that are not just 
relevant but diverse and comprehensive.
