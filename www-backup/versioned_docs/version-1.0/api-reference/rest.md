While gRPC provides low latency and excellent scalability, REST APISs provide 
a more traditional and sometimes simpler integration path. REST is often the 
choice for web-based applications that do not require real-time communication.

## API Formatting Guidelines
You can find all of our APIs at https://<Config v="domains.rest.admin"/>/&lt;version&gt;/&lt;api-endpoint&gt;

The API endpoints are outlined in the various subsections of this API Reference
section. These endpoints are automatically derived from the [protobuf definitions](https://github.com/vectara/protos)
and take the same parameters. At a high level, the `api-endpoint` derives from
[services.proto](https://github.com/vectara/protos/blob/main/services.proto)
specifically, and the API parameters are in other `.proto` files. 

The translation from the protobuf definitions to REST is:
- The only `version` currently available is `v1`.
- `api-endpoint` is lowercase and has hyphens. For example, the gRPC 
  call `CreateCorpus` in services.proto is `/create-corpus`.
- API parameters can be sent in either `camelCase` or lowercase with `underscores`.  
  For example, you could submit either `numResults` or `num_results` in the Search API.
- JSON responses are always returned in `camelCase` form.

## API Authentication
All <Config v="names.product"/> APIs are authenticated. Indexing and Search
APIs can be authenticated via [API Keys](/docs/1.0/learn/authentication/api-key-management).
However, Admin actions for creating and deleting corpora must be done via
[OAuth 2.0](/docs/1.0/learn/authentication/oauth-2).

## API Playground and OpenAPI Specifications
You can find up-to-date OpenAPI specifications at
[https://docs.vectara.com/vectara-oas.yaml](https://docs.vectara.com/vectara-oas.yaml).
These REST API specifications are automatically derived from the gRPC protobuf 
definitions as well.

You can use these with tools of your choosing like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)
or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

1. Download the OpenAPI YAML file.
2. Import the file into Insomonia or Postman.
3. Start making API calls directly from the tool.

our [API Playground](/docs/1.0/rest-api/vectara-rest-api) and make
real-time API calls from your browser.
