The Delete Turns API deletes specific turns from a conversation within the 
chat history corpus. This enables developers to remove inaccurate or 
inappropriate responses from the conversation history. 

The `conversationId` specifies the conversation ID that contains the turn 
you want to delete, and the `turnId` specifies the Turn ID that you want to 
delete.
