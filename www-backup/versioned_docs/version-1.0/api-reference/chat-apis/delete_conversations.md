The Delete Conversations API lets you delete conversations from the chat 
history corpus. This is useful for data management to help ensure that you 
maintain data hygiene and support compliance with data retention policies.

The `conversationId` specifies the IDs of the conversations that you want to  
delete. The limit is 1000 conversations.
