The Disable Turns API disables specific turns from a conversation within the 
chat history corpus. This enables developers to exclude specific responses 
from the conversation history.

The `conversationId` specifies the conversation ID that contains the turn 
you want to disable, and the `turnId` specifies the Turn ID that you want to 
disable.

:::tip

REST endpoint to delete turns in specific chats.
