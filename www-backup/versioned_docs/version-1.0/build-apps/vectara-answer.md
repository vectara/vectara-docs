Vectara Answer provides a configurable sample UI that you can use as a 
starting point. This UI enables users to create custom conversational search 
applications, such as chatbots, semantic search, and workplace search by 
connecting to your ingested data. This project provides example code for a 
modern user-interface for Vectara GenAI conversational search. 

[Go to the code repository](https://github.com/vectara/vectara-answer) for information about
