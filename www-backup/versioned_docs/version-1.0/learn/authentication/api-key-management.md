API Keys allow controlled, anonymous access to several administrative tasks, 
indexing your data, and running semantic searches on your corpora. This 
greatly simplifies integration from public-facing systems like websites. You 
can easily create a [Personal API key](/docs/1.0/console-ui/personal-api-key) or an [Index or Query API Key](/docs/1.0/console-ui/index-and-query-api-keys), 
and then simply embed the API key and directly pass it to <Config v="names.product"/> when issuing requests. If a key 
is compromised, you can quickly revoke the key and replace it in minutes.

Vectara has three kinds of API keys:

## Personal API Key

The Personal API Key helps developers in early stages of exploration and 
prototyping with Vectara. This method provides a straightforward getting 
started experience for integrating accounts with external applications without 
the complexity of OAuth authentication. You can use the Personal API Key when 
putting together a quick prototype, or if you are working on an integration 
that does not yet support OAuth 2.0.

The Personal API Key enables most administrative tasks including creating, 
deleting, and listing corpora, managing API keys for accessible corpora, 
reading usage data, updating corpora filters, executing queries, and indexing.

You cannot use a Personal API Key to delete an account, validate a registration, 
transfer account ownership, or access billing data.

:::caution

A Personal API Key inherits the permissions of its associated user account. 
For example, a key generated by a billing admin will **only** possess 
billing admin-related permissions. Because of their broad access, treat 
Personal API Keys with the same caution as passwords.

:::

## Query API Keys

Query API Keys are recommended for read-only querying operations and are 
designed for embedding in code that runs in potentially insecure environments 
like web browsers or mobile apps. Query API Keys provide the least amount of 
risk because they have a limited scope and do not modify account data.

## Index API Keys

Index API Keys offer a practical solution for development and testing phases 
for when you need read and write access. Because they also provide write 
access, Index API Keys are more powerful than Query API Keys and should be 
treated like passwords and used with caution in production environments.

:::important

Account owners are responsible for charges incurred through anonymous access to
your account with any of these API keys.

:::

:::warning

:lock: Always keep your API Keys and OAuth tokens private. Do not share them 
through email, Slack, Discord, forums, or other public channels because it 
can lead to unauthorized access. Treat these keys with the same 
confidentiality as your personal credentials. 

:::

## Use an API Key

To use a Personal, Index, or Query API key, pass it using the `x-api-key` 
header request.

## Disable and Enable API Keys

To temporarily disable access to an API key, begin by visiting the API Keys
screen. Select disable by clicking on the action menu (three dots) of the key
you want to disable.

![API Key Disable](/img/api_key_disable.png)

It will take around a minute for query requests using this key to be blocked.

Once disabled, a key can be reenabled through the action menu. It will take a
minute or two before it can serve query traffic again.

## Delete API Keys

A key may be permanently deleted through its action menu. 

:::caution

Once deleted, there is no way to undelete it, and all external systems that
issue queries using the key will be blocked.
